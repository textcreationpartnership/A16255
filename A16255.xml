            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And I recke not whether my ſpéeches come to mens eares or no, but will rather, hide them as much as I may, from them all: becauſe the cruell dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges of one falſe man, are here ſo inuectiuely diſcouered of me, that others imagining the like, I might ſooner expect with their ſcornes and tauntes to be flowted, then to be pittied with their ſorrowfull teares.</p>
            <p>I beſéech you (gentle Ladies) to reade it, whom I knowe by my owne ſelfe naturally inclined to commiſeration of my miſfortunes.

But becauſe the time, (ſpent more in wordes, then wailinges,) may not ſlide away, I will force my ſelfe breefely to come to the performaunce of my promiſſe, beginning fyrſt with my happy and ſtedfaſt looue, becauſe deducing in argument from that former felicitie, to this preſent ſtate and condition of life, you may both knowe and call me the moſt vnfortunate woman that liues.

            <p>Accurſed bée that day, and hated of me more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the which I firſt enioyed this common light. Howe happy had I béene (alas) if I had neuer béene borne, or if I had at the time of my vnfortunate byrth, béene carryed to my graue, or had not breathed anie longer time, then the téeth ſowne of <hi>Cadmus:</hi> or els,<note place="margin">The menne borne that were ſowne of Cadmus teeth, lyued but a day</note> if <hi>Lacheſis</hi> at one and ſelfe ſame howre, had begunne and cut in too her vitall thredde: becauſe then, in that ſmall time of life, theſe infinite woes, which are nowe a ſorrowfull occaſion to putte my penne to Paper, ſhoulde wyth the ſame haue béene concluded. But what dooth it nowe auayle for theſe cauſes to lament? For héere I am neuertheleſſe by the generall decrées and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Goddes.</p>
            <p>Béeing receiued then (as I haue ſayde) in moſt hygh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and nouriſhed onelie amongſt them, and in my yong and tender yéeres, brought vppe vnder a reuerend and ſage Matrone, I eaſilie learned euerie good qualitie, which was moſt conuenient and commendable for anie yong and noble Woman. And as my perſonage did wyth paſſed yéeres en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſo were my beauties alſo multiplied, which were the
<pb facs="tcp:2998:6"/> onely and eſpeciall occaſions of all my ſorrowes, and infinite gréefes. Alas (although I was yet but a little one) how great lie did I glory with my ſelfe, in hearing my commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in euery ones mouth, and did therefore with arte and induſtrie dailie ſtudie to make them more perfect and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>But arriued nowe from my childhoode, to a more full and ryper age, and conceauing by the inſtincts of nature, with what burning deſires amorous yong Gentlewomen may entice yong and wanton youthes, I perceiued that my ſurpaſſing beautie,<note place="margin">Beauty hurt full to her that hath it.</note> (a myſerable gift to her, who loues to leade a vertuous life) did not onelie incende moſt of al thoſe yong Gentlemen, who liued at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time in floriſhing youthe like my ſelfe, but manie other noble menne, with a feruent and amorous fire: who infinite times with diuers dryfts, manie meanes, and ſundry ſlights, (vnknowne to mee as then) did attempt to kindle mee with that fire, wherewith they themſelues did burne, and that it ſhould not then onely ſcorche mee, but in proceſſe of time, in long and lingering flames vtterlie conſume mée. And of manie with earneſt ſute, as well to my Parents, as eſpeciallie to mée, I was requeſted in marriage. But after that one among all the reſt (a moſt abſolute (in my opinion) and perfect Gentleman) had wonne that prize, for which they ſtriued all, the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunous and troubleſome route of wooers (béeing nowe paſt all hope,) did ceaſe to ſullicite mée anie more with their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and dailie purſutes. Wherefore remaining in iuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with my louing Huſbande, I liued a moſt happy &amp; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Woman, vntill furious Loue with a ſecrete kinde of vnknowne fire, and neuer felt of mée before, entred into my tender and yong breaſt. Alas there was not anie thing, that might ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

I was the onelie ioy, and ſinguler felicitie of my yong Huſbande, and as hee was truely beloued of mee, ſo did hee equally and greatlie loue me againe.</p>
            <p>O how happy might I haue thought my ſelfe aboue all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2998:6"/> other Women, if this newe loue had for euer continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolated in my hart? Lyuing therefore in great happineſſe, and ſpending my youthfull yéeres in daylie ſports, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feaſtes, falſe Fortune, the ſuddaine chaunger of worldly things, and moſt enuious of the ſelfe ſame goods that ſhe had earſt beſtowed on me, purpoſing nowe to withdrawe her hande, and not knowing by what meanes to ſpett forth her venome, with ſubtile and Sophiſticall arguments, made an aduerſe way (leading to the Dungion of ſorrowe) open to mine eyes. And truely by no other meanes, but by thoſe by which fonde Loue entred into my hart ſhee could entrap me, or vſe her force at all, but the Gods fauorable to me, and carefull of my affayres, perceiuing her couert and malitious guyles, did intend to arme my yéelding hart and féeble breaſt with weapons, if I hadde béene ſo wyſe to haue taken and vſed them for my defence, becauſe I might come forewarned and not vnarmed to the battayle in the which I ſhould mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerablye haue fallen. Wherefore with a manifeſt viſion in my dreames, the verie night before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day (that diſmall day I ſaie) did come, which was the ſorrowfull beginning of my endles paynes, and loſſe of libertie, they did cléerely admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me of future accidents in this ſort.</p>
            <p>Mée thought lying in a faire broade bedde, with euerie part of my bodie reſolued into deepe ſléepe,<note place="margin">Dreames ſomtimes foretell things to come.</note> I ſawe the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and brighteſt day that might be, and my ſelfe (I knowe not how) more iocant and merrie, then euer I had béene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And ioying all alone in this kind of mirth, I did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that I ſat in a ſwéete Medowe, vpon the gréene graſſe, and amongſt manie golden and pleaſant flowres, defended from the heate of the Sunne, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his parching beames, with manie coole ſhadowes of diuers Trées, newly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with thicke and gréene leaues. And hauing gathered manie flowres in the ſame, wherewith all that place was moſt brauelie depainted, with my lyllie white handes I did ſeperate one from another, as they lay confuſed and mingled in my lappe, and with the fineſt that I coulde picke out, I made a fayre and little Garlande, wherewith I did adorne
<pb facs="tcp:2998:7"/> my ſtatelie head. Beautified thus, and ryſing vp (as <hi>Proſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi> did, when <hi>Pluto</hi> didde rauiſhe her from her mother) I went ſinging vp and downe in this pleaſant and trym Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, reioyſing at the entrance of merrie Springtide. And afterwards, féeling my ſelfe ſomewhat wearie, I layde mée downe amongſt the thickeſt and freſheſt graſſe to reſte my ſelfe a little. But like as that little hydden Viper did pricke <hi>Euridices</hi> tender foote, euen ſo a lurking and créeping Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent did likewyſe appeare to my ſight, as I lay along vpon the ſoft and thicke graſſe, the which (me thought) did wyth her cruell tongue ſting me vnder the left pappe, which veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous byting, at the firſt entrance of her ſharpe téeth, dydde ſéeme to burne me like a ſcalding and fierie flame. And then béeing almoſt aſſured, and paſt feare of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt, mee thought I put the colde Serpent into my burning boſome, imagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that wyth the benefit of her colde ſkynne, ſhe ſhoulde a little eaſe me, and be more fauourable vnto me for this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle déede. But emboldened rather by the ſame, and nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more fierce then before, to the foreſayd ſting, ſhe reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her cruell mouth, and hauing after a good while ſucked a great quantitie of my vitall blood, me thought, that meerely going out from my wounded boſome, (though I did ſtryue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrarie) ſhe went alſo away wyth my fainting ſoule. At the departing of which, the golden day obſcured, and (like a ſhadow driuen by the Sunne comming behind me) did co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me all ouer, after which followed a foggy &amp; miſtye dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, accompanied with multitudes of black &amp; thick clowdes, which hanging vpon it, did ſéeme to bee drawne after, and like a confuſed and difformed <hi>Chaos</hi> to follow. And not long after, (as a little white ſtone caſt into a déepe and cléere wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doth by little and little vaniſh away from the ſighte of them that doo beholde it) euen ſo was the brightnes of thys Sunne ſhyne day taken away from my dimmed ſight. Then might I perceiue the Heauens to bee ouercome with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the gladſome Sun retyred backe, and obſcure night approching, made me call to mind, that this ſuddaine altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not vnlike vnto that, which happened to the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:2998:7"/> when the Sunne did hide his face,<note place="margin">Atreus hys fault was, that hee made the Father, which was his brother, to eate hys owne Son, wherupon the Sun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired backe againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would not ſee ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a meſſe and table.</note> becauſe he woulde not for ſhame behold the enormitie of <hi>Atreus</hi> his foule fault. The fearefull lightnings péecemeale glaunced vp and down in the ayre, and cracking thunders made the earth, but mée moſt of all afraide. And the wound which vntill this time, had but onely ſtunge mée (me thought) by reaſon of the late byting, remaining now full of viperous venome, ouerranne, and occupyed all my bodie with moſt filthie and lothſome ſwellings, no ſecrets of phiſicke béeing able to cure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. Whereuppon féeling my ſelfe at the firſt without any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and afterwardes the force of the poyſon by more ſubtill entraunces ſerching euerie vaine of my hart, I tumbled and toſſed my ſelfe vp and downe the gréene graſſe, expecting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes when death would aſſaile mee. And nowe the finall howre (to my thinking) béeing come, terrified alſo with the horror of the time, and with the extreame gréefe of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected hart, attending the mortall ſtroke of death, made mee to ſhryke and ſtart on a ſuddaine in ſuch ſort, that it cauſed my deadly ſléeping bodie to ſhake againe, and ſo brake mee out of that horrible and gaſtlie dreame.</p>
            <p>After the which (as it was very ſuddaine) and not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle afraide alſo of thoſe things, which (me thought) I hadde ſéene, with my right hand I made great ſpéede to my bytten left ſide, ſéeking that preſently there, which was afterwards prepared for me in time to come. But yet when I found no wound, nor anie ſigne thereof, paſſing merrie againe, and careleſſe, I began to deride, and laughe at the fooliſhneſſe of dreames, and ſo accounted the labour of the Goddes héerein but vaine. But, wretch that I am, how iuſtly (though then I ſcorned them) haue I afterwardes to my greate gréefe of minde beléeued, and found them moſt true, and planted them without anie fruite, béeing no leſſe gréeued at the Gods, who declare their ſecrets to vncapable minds with ſo greate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie, the which no ſooner ſhewed, but incontinently they happen. Béeing therefore thorowlie awaked, I lifted vppe my head, and by a little creuiſſe in the dore, did ſée <hi>Titan</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake <hi>Auroras</hi> Chamber, and enter into mine. Wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:2998:8"/> caſting all ſuch fond conceits aſide, I roſe vp.</p>
            <p>That was a high and feſtiuall day almoſt to all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, in the which euerie one, to honor the ſolemnitie of it, atty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelues with their beſt and braueſt robes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, apparrelling my ſelfe moſte curiouſly with garments woouen with ſhyning Golde, and with cunning and ſkilfull hande, ſetting euerie thing in euery part about me in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt order, &amp; adorned like to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayreſt of thoſe thrée Goddeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which <hi>Paris</hi> ſawe in the Valies of <hi>Ida,</hi> I prepared my ſelfe to goe to this ſolemne and high feaſt. And while I was beholding my ſelfe on euerie ſide, not otherwiſe then the Pecock doth her gay Feathers, and imagining as well to pleaſe others, as my ſelfe, one of my flowres (broken from my crowne by the Curtaine of the bedde, or els perhappes plucked from my heade by ſome celeſtiall &amp; inuiſible hande) fell from my head to the ground. But I, taking no regarde of the ſecrete operations of the Goddes, and eſtéeming it as nothing, tooke it vppe, and put it in his former place againe, and ſo paſſed it ſlightlie ouer.</p>
            <p>Alas what more manifeſt ſigne coulde the Goddes giue me of that, which afterwards did happen then this. Truely none at all. This had béene ſufficient inough to declare vnto me, that my ſoule, that day ſo frée, and miſtreſſe of it ſelfe, laying downe her ſwéete ſignorie, ſhoulde bee made ſeruile and bonde, as it happened indéede. Oh if my mind had béene ſounde, howe had I not then foreknowne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day, (that blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt day) that afterwards happened vnto me, and had ſafely ouerpaſſed it without going once out of my dores. But the Goddes although they lende them (with whom they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry) certaine ſignes and tokens of their welfare, yet do they neuertheleſſe depriue them of the due knowledg of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. And ſo in one howre ſéeme to doo their willing deuoyre, and to fulfill their wrathfull minds. My hard deſtinies therfore did (as it were) driue me on forwards like a vain &amp; careleſſe Woman, and béeing accompanied with many Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that ſerued on my trayne, with a ſoft and ſtately pace, I went to the holy Temple, in which the ſollemne and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2998:8"/> office, due for that day, was celebrated. The antiquitie of my generous predeceſſors, and my nobilitie alſo had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued a high place for me, amongſt other moſt excellent and worthie Ladies there, in the which, after that I was ſette, obſeruing my olde cuſtome, which was, in ſuddainly caſting mine eyes rounde about, I ſawe the Church equally full of of Men and Women, in diuers companies, diuerſly to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelues. But no ſooner was I eſpyed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Temple, though in the midſt of ſacred ſeruice time, but (as it was a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon thing many times before ſo then did it alſo fall out) that not Men onely, but euery woman did turne their eies towards mee, to beholde mée: and wondering at mee, as if <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Minerua</hi> (neuer ſéene of them before) hadde béene verelie come down from Heauen amongſt them.</p>
            <p>O howe manie times did I ſmyle with my ſelfe, féeling ſuch content to tickle mee, and glorying in my ſelfe no leſſe then a Goddeſſe, béeing not a little proude of all theſe moſte happy fauours.

And euerie one after his owne fancie, ſpeaking and diuerſly diſcourſing of my beautie, but all concurring and concluding in one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, did highlie extoll and commende it.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2998:9"/> I was wont to doo, and the percing beames of his fayre eyes encountring with mine, me thought, that with a pittiful and ſwéete countenaunce bee ſéemed to ſpeake theſe wordes. <hi>O Lady, thou art mine onely ioy and ſinguler felicitie.</hi> Truely if I ſhould ſay, that theſe wordes did not worke an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie delight in me, I ſhoulde flatly lye: the ſuppoſition of which did ſo highly pleaſe mee, that from the center of my hart they drew forth a ſwéete and profound ſigh, which came accompanied with theſe words. <hi>And thou art myne.</hi> But that remembring my ſelfe, I tooke them from my mouth. But what did it auaile? That which was not expreſſed and vttered forth, my hart did conceiue &amp; imagine with it ſelfe, retaining y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in it, which if it had gone forth, perhaps I ſhold haue yet béene frée. Then from that time forwarde, making my fooliſh eyes the whole arbyters of that, the good where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were ſo gréedy to enioy, I did (me thought) in ſo doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatlie content &amp; pleaſe them. And certes if the Gods, who deduct all thinges to ſome knowne and certaine ende, had not taken away my vnderſtanding, and bereaued me of my due knowledge, I myght haue ſtyll béene myne owne woman. But all ſuch conſiderations layde aſide, I followed my ſenſual appetite, &amp; quickly perſwaded my ſelfe to yéeld to loue: Becauſe no otherwiſe then the elementarie coruſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhooting themſelues from one parte of the ayre to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a ſhyning light iſſuing from out hys cléere eyes, &amp; run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by a moſt ſubtile and fine beame, did méete and hytte directly againſt mine, which contending to paſſe furder, by what ſecret wayes (I knowe not) ſuddainly went penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to my very hart, which fearing theyr violent entrance, and calling to it all her exterior forces, left me altogether pale and colde: But their aboade was not ſo long there, but the greateſt feare was paſt, and then were they welcomed wyth a hote and burning paſſion: wherevpon the foreſayde forces returning to their places againe, brought with them a certaine heate, which driuing all palenes quite away, payn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted my face like the vermillion Roſe, and made me burne as hote as fire: And yet beholding from whence all this dydde
<pb facs="tcp:2998:10"/> procéede, I could not but breathe out a ſorrowfull ſigh. And from that howre forwarde, my thoughtes were occupyed in nothing els, but meditating of his braue perſonage, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant vertues, and eſpecially in imagining howe to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>In all theſe intercourſes, without chaunging of place or countenaunce, he did moſt priuilie ſteale now &amp; then a looke at me againe. And peraduenture as one who hadde béene a tryed Souldiour in other amorous battailes, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with what Engines his wyſhed praye might beſt be taken, wyth arguments of greater humilitie, continually he ſhewed himſelfe more pittifull, and full of amorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Alas how much deceite was hydden vnder the vaile of that pietie, which (according as the preſent effects doo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie) béeing nowe mortified in his hart, where it neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued againe,) bare onely but an outward ſhow and vyſard of loue? And becauſe I may proſecute euery thing &amp; action in perticuler, whereof there was not any, which was not fraught with rare fraude and cunning guile, whither it was he, that voluntarily did worke it, or my vnlucky ſtars, that would haue it ſo, thus it fell out, that (wanting the due ſkyl exactly to ſhew you how) I found my ſelfe entangled wyth ſuddaine and vnlooked for loue, as at this preſent I am not frée from the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">Thys therefore was he (moſt pittifull Ladyes) whom my conquered hart wyth a fooliſh conceite, amongſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie noble, beautifull, and valiant yong Gentlemen, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were not onely there preſent, but alſo in all my <hi>Parthenope,</hi> dyd chooſe to be the firſt,<note place="margin">Naples.</note> the onely, and laſt Lorde and maiſter of my life. This was he, whom I loued, and do loue ſtyll more then anie one in all the worlde beſides. Thys was hee who was the beginning and principall occaſion of all my woes, and ſhalbe (as I hope) the finall cauſe of my tragicall death at laſte. Thys was that day, in the which, firſt of a moſt frée and happy Lady, I became a moſt miſerable &amp; vnhappy captiue. Thys was that day, in the which I did firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende the miſerable effects of fooliſh loue, neuer knowne of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2998:10"/> me before. This was that day, wherin venereous venoms contaminated firſt my pure and chaſte breaſte. Alas poore wretch, how manie ſorrowes, and what miſery came thys day into the world to thée, by thine owne default? Howe far (alas) ſhould annoy and griefe haue béene from me, yf thys day had béene turned into darknes? and howe great an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie was this day to my vnſtayned honor?</hi>

I was therefore taken (as I haue ſayde) and whither it was ſome infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall furie, or enuious fortune, which did ſo emulate my chaſt felicitie, laying ſnares to entrappe mee, may thys day wyth hope of infallible victory tryumph and reioyce in my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fall. Béeing therefore poſſeſſed, nay rather oppreſſed with new kinds of paſſions, as one aſtonied, and like a ſence<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe Woman I ſatte amongſt the other Ladyes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen. And troubled thus in mind, I did neglect the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and diuine ſeruice, which as I did ſcarcely heare, ſo dyd I not vnderſtande it at all: and thought the ſundry ſpeeches and diſcourſes of Gentlewomen, that ſatte round about me, but a kind of buzzing and murmuring in my troubled eares. And ſo this newe and vnexpected loue did take ſuddaine poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of my tender hart, ſo that eyther wyth myne eyes, or with my thoughtes I was euer contemplating on my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued yong Gentleman. And yet my ſimplicitie was ſuch, that I did not almoſt then know, what ende I might wyſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſuch a ſtraunge and feruent paſſion. How many times (alas) coueting to haue ſéene him approche néere vnto mee, did I blame his ſtaying behind al the reſt of the Gentlemen, thinking wyth my ſelfe that that was but a colde kinde of affection in him, which he did perhaps craftilie vſe, and for a pollicie, to make mee more deſirous to looke on hym, and in looking to loue him more.</p>
            <p>And moreouer, the companie of luſtie youthes, that ſtoode before hym, did greatly hinder my ſight, of whom, whilſt that I buſied myne eyes in looking ſometimes amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there were not a fewe, that, (thinking, that for theyr ſakes
<pb facs="tcp:2998:11"/> I looked ſo much towards them) did vainely perhappes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, that I did it for loue of them. But while my thoughts and ſences were occupyed in theſe fancyes, the ſollemne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice was finiſhed: and the Ladyes and the reſt of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were riſen vp to depart, when I, recalling my wits together, which went wandring about the ſwéete imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and figure of theyr onely obiect, at the laſt I beheld my louelie yong Gentleman againe. And now my ſelfe riſen vp with the other Gentlewomen ready to be gone, and turning mine eyes towardes him, I perceiued that by his pittifull lokes (which I had thought to haue preuented by mine) that his departure, and mine didde greatlie gréeue him. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, after certaine ſecrete ſighes, and yet ignorant of what parentage, eſtate and condition hee was, I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>Alas (gentle Ladies) who would beléeue it poſſible, that ones hart in a moment and point of time ſhoulde alter and chaunge ſo much? Who would ſay that a man neuer ſéene before might be ſo extreamelie loued at the firſt ſight? And who would thinke, that the deſire of ſéeing ſhould bee ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentlie kindled in ones breaſt, as the very ſight it ſelfe, and béeing depriued of that, to féele the greateſt paine in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, for deſire to ſée the ſame thing againe? Who would imagin that all thoſe things, that haue béene ſo ioyfull and delightful to vs before, in reſpect of a newe thing come in place, ſhould not yéelde anie more pleaſure at all. Not any one truely, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had prooued and felt them, as I doo nowe. Alas that loue is not onelie content to vſe ſuch a ſtrange, and too ſeuere kinde of crueltie towardes mee,<note place="margin">Howe loue is enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred in diuers parts and ſoules of the body ſucceſſiuely,</note> but in ſubduing mee to his might, to preſcribe new Lawes, cléene variant from others. I haue oftentimes hearde, that loue in others at his firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance is but light, but by nouriſhed thoughtes augmenting his force, is made greater. But ſo it fared not with mee: for he entred into my heart wyth that ſame force, wherwith hée continued euer afterwardes, as one, who at the verye firſte aſſault had moſt entyre and frée poſſeſſion of me. And lyke as the gréene wood, which is hardly at the firſt ſette on fire, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2998:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> doth lie a long time, before it receiueth flames, but after it is once kindled, with greater heate dooth conſerue the fire longer, euen ſo it happened vnto me, who with this kynd of pleaſing paſſion, neuer ouercome of any before (though at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted of many) and at the laſt conquered of one, haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and kept, (as yet I doo more ſenſibly) theſe new flames, that haue taken more hold of mee, then euer they did of anie other, who before haue aſſayed the like. But leauing aſide many thoughts, which with diuers accidents that morning turmoyled my troubled mind, and beſides theſe, which nowe I haue told, I ſay, that béeing incended with a newe furie, with my captiuated and bonde ſoule I returned againe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from whence (not long ſince) I had brought it frée.</p>
            <p>Where afterwardes, that I was nowe come into my Chamber all alone, kindled with variety of burning deſires ſurcharged with new thoughts, and pricked with a thouſand ſtinging cares, terminating euerie ende of them in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined apprehenſion of my yong Gentleman, I thought, that if I coulde not weane my ſelfe from this newe loue, at the leaſt in my ſecret and ſorrowfull breaſt, wiſely to haue nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and gouerned the ſame, and warilie to haue brought it to ſome good effect. Which things, howe difficult they are to performe, none can tell vnleſſe they proue them, vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlie beléeuing, that they doo no leſſe harme, then loue it ſelfe. Wherefore, confirmed as it were in this opinion, I ſaide thus to my ſelfe. <q rend="margQuotes">Alas thou art in loue poore ſoule, and yet thou dooſt not know with whom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What kinds of cruell thoughts, and howe many carefull cogitations were engendred of this loue, it ſhoulde be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for you daintie Ladies to heare, and to gréeuous for me to tell. But yet (though forcing my ſelfe thereunto) to obtayne the more pittie at your handes, and ſome comfort thereby, I meane to vnfolde ſome of them vnto you. I ſay therefore, that careleſſe of all other thinges, to ſpende y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time in thinking of my beloued and amiable yong Gentlemanne, was only moſt deare and pleaſant vnto me. And imagining with my ſelfe, that perſeuering in this, that which I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:2998:12"/> to conceale, might perhaps haue eaſily béene preſumed, I oftentimes found fault with my ſelfe for it. But what did it helpe? My owne reprehenſions gaue place to my deſires, and like words of light worth paſſed away with the ayre. I chiefely deſired manie daies together, to knowe what my beloued youth was, to the vnderſtandinge of which thing, newe thoughts made me an open way, by meanes of which moſt warily and priuilie I knewe it, and whereof I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not a little contented. My goodly ornaments likewyſe, which (as one that little néede them) were not before thys time ſo much in requeſt with me, began now to be greatlie liked of me, thinking that béeing adorned with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I myght pleaſe the more: Wherefore I eſtéemed nowe more of gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious apparrell, gold, pearles, and other precious ſtones, and gemmes, then euer I did before. And I, who vntil this time had frequented the holy Temples, Feaſtes, Sea banks, and pleaſant Gardens, without any further intent or deſire, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to kéepe other Gentlewomen and Ladyes company, began, (altered now in mind) for new purpoſes to reſorte more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the foreſaid places, thinking, that there I might with pleaſure not onely beholde, but with delight and deſire bee ſéene againe. But the great affiaunce (truely) which I was wont to haue in my beautie, forſooke me nowe quite, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I neuer went out of my Chamber, without the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble counſell of my truſtie Glaſſe: And my cunning handes, (I know not by what curious inſtructor newly taught) find<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing euerie day more braue and rare ornaments, conioyning artificiall with naturall beautie, did make mee like <hi>Venus</hi> ſtarre) ſhine amongſt other Ladyes. The great honours moreouer, curteſies, and obeiſance, which other Ladyes and Gentlewomen of theyr méere good wyls, and dueties did vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to me, although indéede they were incident to my nobilitye, I nowe began to accept and expect as ſeruices duely &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily belonging to my high eſtate, thinking that I ſhoulde pleaſe my louer moſt of all, when by theſe meanes he didde perceiue, that I was of noble byrth and lynage. And that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon couetouſnes, which is naturally borne and ingraffed in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2998:12"/> all Women, did worke in mee (eſchewing the ſame) no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects, then to eſtéeme of all my riches, land &amp; treaſure, as if they had not béene mine owne: wherby I became not onelie liberall, but féeling alſo a certaine ſéemelie boldnes to encreaſe in me, made me deuoide of all womanlie and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious feare, accounting but one thing only déerer to me now then before. And beſides all this, my eyes which vntill this time had béen but ſimple, and vnexpert in amorous regards chaunged their former faſhions, and grewe meruailous ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in performing their parts. And I diſcouered moreouer in me diuers other mutations, all which by one and one, I care not to ſet downe, becauſe firſt, it would bée too long a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſecondlie, becauſe I beléeue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you (faire Ladyes) enamored perhaps like my ſelfe, are not ignorant how great and manie thoſe are, which accompany louers in like cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>The yong Gentleman was moſt warie and wiſe, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times by experience I was ſufficiently thereof acertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Hee came but ſeldome times, and that in moſte honeſt and ſéemely ſort where I was, and hauing (as it ſéemed) pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed the ſelfe ſame thing, that I hadde doone, which was to conceale altogether theſe amorous flames, did yet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priuie and ſtealing lookes, not a fewe times pittifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde me. He did therfore make thoſe kindled flames in me, more feruent and liuelie, and reuiued thoſe againe, (yf anie they were) that were ſpent and quite conſumed in me. But the beginning of all this loue was not ſo ioyfull and happy, but the ſequell and ende of it was more ſorrowfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, at what time I remained depriued of his ſight, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe theſe eyes béeing denyed their wiſhed ioy, did miniſter a gréeuous occaſion to my poore harte of gréefe, whereuppon my ſighes both in quantitie and quallitie were greatly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented: And hote deſire, occupying almoſt euery leaſt ſence of myne, did make me liue as one beſides my ſelfe,<note place="margin">Diuers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of loue eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a weake mind</note> and as if I had not béene there where I was, made many that ſawe me, to wonder often times at me, attributing afterwardes infinite and feyned occaſions (taught mee onely of loue) to
<pb facs="tcp:2998:13"/> ſuch ſtrange and vncouth accidents. And beſides all thys, taking from mee manie times my ſwéete reſte in the night time, and appetite in the day, did driue me ſometimes to cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne ſuddaine and furious kinds of actions, and tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my tongue into ſtrange and fonde ſpéeches. Behold how my vnaccuſtomed gorgious apparrell, my prodigall attyre, my ſcalding and newe ſighes, my vnwonted geſture, fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke fits, the loſſe of my reſt, quietnes, and health, and many other things, which this newe loue brought wyth it, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt many other Seruaunts and familiars in my houſe, made a Nurce of mine eſpecially to meruaile much, who, as ſhee was burdened with many yéeres, ſo in rype wyſedome and good experience ſhee was not yong at all. And who hauing ſometimes knowne and tryed the heate of <hi>Cupids</hi> flames, and making ſemblance to the contrary, did oftentimes repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hende me, and my ſuſpected follies. But finding me on a day laide vpon my bedde, and oppreſſed with déepe melancholy and ſadnes, and perceiuing by my face, that I was ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with burdens of heauy thoughts,<note place="margin">The Nurce her ſpeeche to Fiam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metta.</note> and ſéeing no company with me but her ſelfe, began thus to ſay vnto me.</p>

But it may be, in ſubmitting thy ſelfe to him, thou dooſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome bitter reprehenſion, and dooſt (perhaps) feare ſome ſhame to enſue thereof, which can by no meanes fall vnto thée, ſince a thouſande more excellent women then thy ſelfe, hauing committed tenne thouſand greater faultes then this ſhall ſufficiently excuſe thée, and, as great preſidentes of this thy reaſonable lappes (if ſo it be) exempte thée from reproch: who, as thou art not ſo mightie as they, haſt not erred ſo much as they haue doone. But if thoſe motiues doo not alter thy minde, and yet perhappes will obſtinately ſtill reſiſte. Thinke that thou canſt not ioyne with <hi>Iupiter</hi> in vertue, with <hi>Iuno</hi> in ritches, with <hi>Apollo</hi> in wiſedome, and with me in beauty. And if all we haue béene ouercome, dooſt thou
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2998:18"/> onely thinke to triumphe in thy ſole conqueſt? Thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, if thou art of this opinion, and ſhalt ſuffer a baſe foile in thine own prowd conceite. Let that ſuffiſe thée, which here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tofore hath béene enough, and to much for heauen and earth, and make not thy ſelfe ſo timerous in ſaying. I haue a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and holy lawes and promiſed faith forbiddeth me theſe thinges, becauſe they are but vaine conceites and friuolous obiections againſt his vertue. For lyke a ſtrong and mighty Prince he dooth plant his eternall lawes, when, not caringe for other of meaner ſubſtaunce, hée dooth account them but baſe and ſeruile rules. <hi>Paſiphae</hi> likewiſe had a huſband, and <hi>Phedra,</hi> and I my ſelfe, when I looued. Nay huſbands them ſelues for the moſt part looue other women, when they haue wiues of their owne, as <hi>Iaſon</hi> for example, <hi>Hercules</hi> and wiſe <hi>Vliſſes.</hi> No iniurie therefore is offered vnto them, if that they are counterchecked with thoſe lawes, which they themſelues vſe towardes other. No prerogatiue is graunted more to them, then to wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore abandon theſe fooliſh and vnconſtant thoughts, and looue ſecurely as thou haſt bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne. Beholde if thou wilt not ſubmit thy ſelfe to mighty looue, of neceſſitie thou muſt flie away, &amp; whether wilt thou take thy flight but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil purſue, &amp; ouertake thée? his pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er is a like in euery place, and whereſoeuer thou goeſt thou art ſtill in his kindomes, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which none can hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues no longer then it pleaſeth him to ſuffer them. Let this ſuffiſe thée (young Ladie) that thou art not moleſted with ſuch abho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minable and wicked luſt, as <hi>Mirra, Semiramis, Biblis, Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cleopatra</hi> were. My Son ſhal worke in thée no ſtraung and new thinges. He dooth rule by lawes as well as other Gods, in following which, thou muſt perſwad thy ſelfe, that thou art not the firſt, and ſhalt not be the laſt. And if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture thou dooſt beléeue, that thou dooſt at this preſent loue alone, thy beléefe is but vaine, and falſe. For to let the other world paſſe in ſilence, which is full of them, let vs onely looke into thy noble Citty, in the which thou haſt many braue and infinite companions. And note this withall, that what hath béene, and is doone of ſo many wiſe and iudicious perſons,

Followe vs therefore, and with thankfull wordes and grate<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full déeds requite our deitie for thy péereleſſe beauty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit not to remember her, who hath out of the number of ſimple &amp; ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſoules choſen &amp; tooke thée, to make thée know &amp; participate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleaſure of our gifts.</q> Alas good Ladies, what ſhold or could I anſwer, to ſuch perſwaſiue or forcible reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s alleaged by ſo mighty a Goddeſſe, but only this.

            <p>I had ſcarcelie ſpoken theſe wordes, when moouing from the place where ſhe ſtood, ſhe came to me, and with a feruent kinde of affection and merrie countenaunce embracing mée, ſhe firſt kiſſed my forehead, and afterwardes, as falſe <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> breathing ſecréet and burning fire into <hi>Dido</hi> her mouth ſo ſhe reſpiring the lyke into mine, made my firſt deſires more whot, and my paſſions more feruent, as after to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of my tormented hart I felte them.

            <p>Alas poore wretch that I am, could I other wiſe thinke trying the ſequelles of her ſugered ſuggeſtions, and of my enſuing miſeries, but that this counterfaite Goddeſſe, was rather cruell <hi>Cteſiphone,</hi> then gentle <hi>Venus,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thus appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto me, who laying aſide for a while her vglie and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heaire, no otherwiſe then <hi>Iuno</hi> the ſhining glory of her deity, and taking vpon her a deuine forme, as ſhe did an olde and crooked ſhape, repreſented her before my eyes, as ſhée came to <hi>Semele,</hi> giuing me, as ſhe did alſo her, ſwéet counſell mixte with reueng and poyſonne of my finall ouerthrowe and helpleſſe fall: receiuing which into my miſerable breſt, was the greateſt occaſion, and only cauſe, O godly fayth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend ſhame, and moſt holy chaſtity, to driue and baniſhe you from the ſame, from that then chaſt (I meane) but nowe vnworthy and ſpotted breſt of myne. But pardon ſwéete ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues, pardon me, if due penaunce of a ſinner, and ſuſtayned puniſhment of this guilte, may impetrate any remiſſion or fauour at all.

And though I was truely by diuers intermediate chaunces greatly conſtrained, yet ſo much fauour was graunted mée, that without ouercharging the marke, and ſtoutlie endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the gréefe, I paſſed it well away. And yet in truth the forces which I yet haue, are of ſufficient power to vpholde and conſerue ſuch counſayle. Becauſe (although I write moſt true things) I haue in ſuch order ſet them downe, that except he, who dooth knowe them as well I, being the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of them all, no other, were he of neuer ſo ſharpe a witte and readie conceite, could, vnderſtande and knowe that it was I. And euen him I pray (if this little booke chaunce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to come to his handes,) that, for that looue which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he bare me, he would conceale that, which in manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it, would not turne to his honor or profitte. And if hee haue taken that looue from me without any demerite of my owne part, that at the leaſt, he would not diſpoſſeſſe me of that honor, which, (admit that iniuſtlie I haue it) he cannot (though he would) render vnto me againe. Adhering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this determination, and brideling my eger deſires, and too to foreward in their owne diſcouery, with a ſtrained and vnpatient rayne of ſufferaunce, I endeuored with all di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligence (and at my fitteſt oportunity) by aluring meanes, and did practiſe fine &amp; ſubtile demonſtrances to kindle the young gentleman with thoſe coales, with the which my ſelfe was inflamed, and to warne him to be as warie, &amp; cunning in his proper affayres, as I was wiſe &amp; circumſpect in my actions.</p>
            <p>In bringing which to ſpéedy effect, daungerous delayes were not deferred, and thought not my trauile in the ſame, eyther to long or to great,<note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times comprehen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded in theſe which are a like.</note> becauſe if the true teſtimonie of the qualities of the hart is compriſed in thoſe, which are not different in paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I quickly perceiued, that wiſhed effects

With as earneſt care ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore and due conſideration, tendring my vnſuſpected honor, as alſo to ſatiſfie his déepe deſires, when time and place dyd graunt him fit oportunitie, he did ſeriouſly ſolilicite me, and (as I beléeue) not without great paine, trying the vtmoſt of his ſkil) to gaine the familiaritie of euery one, that was née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt allyed, &amp; did daily conuerſe with me, but eſpecially and laſt of al, to inſinuate into the acquaintaunce of my huſband and firmely to purchaſe his freendſhip.

            <p>This ſinguler and wiſhed priuiledge, I enioyed by this happy familiaritie, that publiquely, and in all companies I might talke with him, and he diſcourſe with me againe. Who thinking it nowe hie time to procéede to matters of greater effects, ſometimes with ſome other (perceiuing that I might both héere and vnderſtand him) diſcourſed of ſuche thinges, by the which I knewe, (moſt willing to learne the principles of this newe lawe) not by his talke onely,<note place="margin">Not with words one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, but with actions and geſture loue may be ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifeſted,</note> which he had with others, that he could cunningly and ſubtillie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his affection, and finely haue an aunſwer thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but with diuers motions alſo of his handes, and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his countenaunce, and body, he coulde paſſing well perfourme the ſame. And thus with pretty leſſons pleaſing my willing minde ſo much, I learned alſo to bee ſo diligent and warie a ſcholler, that I would not tell him any thing, or he to me againe, but by theſe vnſuſpected meanes, whereby equally and iuſtly we conceiued our hidden conceits. Nor be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:2998:21"/> yet content with theſe honeſt helpes, by figuratiue ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and inuented names hee taught mee howe to ſpeake in open company, to make me therby more aſſured of his fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uent looue, calling me by the name of <hi>Fiammetta,</hi> and hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>Pamphilus:</hi> Alas howe many times in the preſence of my ſelfe, and of my déereſt fréendes being prittely heated with feaſting, and looues eates, did he deuiſe (fayning <hi>Fiam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metta</hi> and <hi>Pamphilus</hi> to be <hi>Grecians</hi>) how I with him, and he with me, were firſt combyned in loouing bondes: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes what accidentes did enſue of this <hi>Grecian</hi> looue, collouring his forged nouell with fit and fayned names. It made me truely many times to laughe, not ſo much at the grauitie and conterfaite modeſtie in his diſcourſe, as at the ſimplicitie and good meaning of thoſe, who gaue eare and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>léefe to his tale.</p>
            <p>And yet I was ſometimes afrayd, leaſt that both his diſordinate heates might haue vnaduiſedly (perhappes) tranſported his tongue thether, whether, it would afterwar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des haue repented, that it runned. But as he was a more pru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent &amp; perfect ſcholler, then I tooke him to be, ſo did he crafte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly take héede of ſpeaking of falſe Latine. O gentle and pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ladies, what dooth not looue teache his ſubiectes: and whom dooth not he enable to learne wiſe diſcourſes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainte him with braue and commendable faſhione?</p>
            <p>My ſelfe being but a young and ſimple woman in ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,<note place="margin">Looue a cunning maſter.</note> and ſcarce able amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt other gentlewomen my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, in plaine and common thinges to vntie my vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tongue, by giuing a willing and an affectioned eare to his ſpéeches, did reape thereby ſo much fruite, that in a ſhort time, in fayning and talking I thought I did excell euery famous Poet.

But all theſe ſhiftes would ſéeme but ſhadowes, and of no conſequence, if I did write and ſet downe (if preſent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

But the bondes of our loues were ſo faſt knit, and of ſuch rare tenour, that the graueſt, wiſeſt, and ſtrongeſt perſonages in like paſſages ſhould haue gotte them high and worthy praiſes. But now my ſtayned penne, with an vnbridled and wanton deſire, dooth prepare it ſelfe to write of thoſe finall termes of loue, beyond y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which none can paſſe furder with déede or deſire whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>But before I come to this point, as humbly as I may, I implore (gentle Ladyes) your pietie, and therewithall that amorous force, which, poſſeſſing your tender breaſtes, dooth alſo draw your burning deſires to ſuch an end.

I ſay, that then I thanked infinite times the holly Goddeſſe, the promiſer, and performer of theſe ſwéete ioyes: Oh how many times crow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned with her gréene leaues, did I viſit her ſacred Temples, offering vp ſwéete incenſe to her diuine Aulters, and howe often did I condemne the olde Nurce, and her ſimple coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: and did beſides this (reioyſing and glorying my ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other enamoured yong Gentlewomen and Ladies, that I knewe and kept company with) ſcorne and laughe at their ridiculous &amp; appaſſionated loues, blaming that in my ſpéeches, which was déereſt to my ſoule, ſaying many times to my ſelfe. <q rend="margQuotes">There is no woman beloued ſo as I am, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lady, bée ſhee neuer ſo noble and faire, that dooth loue ſo braue, ſo wiſe, and ſo worthy a yong Gentlemanne as I doo, nor that doth with ſo greate delight and pleaſure reape ſuch amorous fruite in a paradiſe of all ioy, nor in ſo great aboun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dance, as I moſt happilie and hourely doo taſte.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to bee ſhort, in reſpect of this, I eſtéemed the whole world as a trifle of no accounte, and thought that I reached the higheſt heauens with my thriſe happy heade, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as I thought) nothing els to attaine to the higheſt top of felicitie, and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> full accompliſhment of all my pleaſures and ſwéete contents, but onely to haue had the occaſion of all my bliſ-full ioy, and bleſſed fortune manifeſted, and made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly knowne to the worlde, thinking with my ſelfe, that that which delighted me ſo much, ſhould (as my ſelfe) haue pleaſed euery one alike: But thou Oh baſhfulneſſe on the one ſide, and thou feare on the other, you haue (I ſay) with helde me, the one threatning me eternall infamie, and the other, the loſſe of that, of which indéede enuious fortune did afterwards miſerably deſpoyle me.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore I paſſed this golden and gladſome time

            <p>After that he and I (the weather falling out verie colde and rainie) were in my Chamber together, repoſing and ſol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lacing our ſelues vppon a ſumptuous and ſwéete bedde, and Lady <hi>Citherea</hi> wearied, nay almoſt ouercome, the dark and ſilent night with her long tariance fauourably graunted to our pleaſant and deſired ſports, fitte oportunitie of time and place: And a great light hanging in the midſt of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber glutted his eyes and myne, (viewing each others beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) with excéeding ioy: of which, while I recreated my mind in gazing and diſcourſing of his, mine eyes did drinke a ſuperfluous kind of ſwéetnes, which (making their lights inebriated (as it were) with the ſame, with deceitfull ſléepe (I know not how) a little while oppreſſed, and my wordes interrupted alſo in the middes) remained locked vppe cloſe in their lyddes.</p>

            <p>After he had thus taken his leaue, ouercome poore wretch with extreame anguiſh of minde, and wofull waylinges, I could ſcarce aunſwere him any thing againe, but yet at the laſt by plaine and maine force, I did fetch theſe trembling words out of my ſadde and heauie minde. <q rend="margQuotes">Thy aſſured faith ſolemnly promiſed to mee, and ſincerely giuen by thy ryght hand to mine, let <hi>Iupiter</hi> confirme in heauen with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effecte, as <hi>Iſis</hi> did the prayers of <hi>Teleteuſe,</hi> and make it ſo perfecte and entire in earth, as I doo effectually deſire, and as y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> dooſt with ſacred oath require.</q> And accompanying him to my Palace gate,<note place="margin">The effect of an ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured woman.</note> and opening my lips to bidde him farewell, ſud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dainly my words were taken from my tongue, and the light of heauen from mine eyes.

And hoping that he was yet at the gate, like a fierce Bull, hauing receaued a mortall wounde, furiouſlye rouſeth himſelfe, running and leaping héere &amp; there, ſo I amazed and lyfting vppe my dimmed eyes, which hadde ſcarcely yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their perfecte ſight, ranne eagerlie vppon my Maide wyth open armes to embrace her, thinking to haue claſped my <hi>Panphilus</hi> betwéene them, and with a faint and hoarce voyce, broken as it were in a thouſand péeces, with inceſſant

But not conceiuing yet in the depth of my minde, what ſhould happen vnto me indéede, I let theſe, as vayne and friuolous imaginations paſſe away, which did neuer the ſooner at my will and pleaſure departe, but when others comming a freſhe in their places, then did theſe forſake my melancolike minde.</p>

            <p>Wherfore I dyd firſt greatly doubt with my ſelfe, leaſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſmalleſt of theſe gréefes might not haue bene meanes forcible enough to haue taken him from me, and feared againe, leaſt his vnwoonted trauailes, and the hurtefull and vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weather might haue béene an occaſion of ſickneſſe, or of ſome worſe miſchaunce, that might haue hindered his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeignes,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2998:36"/> and ſo hurt my deſires.

            <p>Thus therfore, in oppoſing, anſwering &amp; diſſoluing my owne obiections, I ſpent ſo many daies, that I dyd not onely thinke, that he was now arriued in his countrie, but I was alſo certified thereof by his letters, which for many cauſes were moſt welcome and acceptable vnto me: in the which he certified me, that with greater flames of affection, he burned more in my looue, then euer he did, and with ſtronger promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did reuiue my hope of his returne.

And afterwards faſtning myne eies ſtedfaſtly towards the Eaſt, I did mark how much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sun, eleuated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the <hi>Horiſon,</hi> had ſpent of the new day, and the more I ſaw it higher, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more I ſaid (to my ſelfe) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> terme of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>philus</hi> his return drew on, and many times I did with great delight as it were, ſée it riſe &amp; come forth, &amp; diſcerning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times my own ſhadow, by the aſcended quantity of it in the <hi>Meridiall</hi> line, made leſſe &amp; leſſe, and ſomtimes loking to the ſpace of his body, made bigger by the earth in his ſetting, I ſaid with my ſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee went more ſlowly, then euer he did before, and did lengthen the daies more in <hi>Capricorne,</hi> then he was wont to do in <hi>Cancer,</hi> and ſo likewiſe mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vp to the middle circle, I ſaide y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there he ſtaied too long to delight himſelfe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2998:38"/> in ouerloking the wide earth. And although hee glided down ſwiftly towards the weſt, yet me thought he was too long in his courſe again, whoſe light after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Hemiſphere had loſt, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> twinckling ſtars had ful ſcope to ſhew forth theirs, thus partly contented,<note place="margin">Louers mark their daies with ſtones</note> I went numbring &amp; calling to mind many times with my ſelf the daies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were paſt, &amp; with litle ſtones did mark thoſe with other daies alſo that were to come, no otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in times (paſt deuiding their mery and happy daies from their ſorrwful and diſmal times with litle black &amp; white ſtones) were wont to doo. O howe many times do I now reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> before their due time I did put a ſtone there, thinking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo much of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſcribed terme ſhould be diminiſhed, howe much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſooner I adioyned it to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which was already paſt, ſomtimes counting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle ſtones aſſigned for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies paſt, and ſomtimes telling thoſe, which ſtoode for thoſe daies, which were yet to come, although I kept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber of euery one of them very wel in my minde (thinking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery time to haue found ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> increaſed, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhold haue béen diminiſhed. So did my eager hote deſire tranſport me to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſhed end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prefixed terme. Vſing ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore theſe vain cares, I returned many times to my deſolate chamber, more deſirous to be there all alone, then willinglie in any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany. And when I was alone, to driue away ſorow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful cogitations, I opened a certain caſket of mine, out of the which I tooke many things (ſomtimes his fauours beſtowed on me) by one &amp; one, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> delight &amp; great deſire, which once I had in beholding him, I did now take in gazing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, which when I had ſéene, ſcarce able to containe my ſwelling teares, yet fetching great ſighes, I kiſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and as if they had béen rational creatures, &amp; things of vnderſtanding, I did aſke them ſaying. When wil your M. be here? &amp; laying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp again, I drew forth many of his leters which he had ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times ſent me, &amp; reading almoſt euery one of them ouer, and imagining y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I did talke with him, I felt no litle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. I cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led oftentimes my faithful &amp; ſecret maid vnto me, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had much and diuers communication touching him, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſking her what her hope was of hys returne, and
<pb facs="tcp:2998:39"/> ſometimes what ſhee thought of him, or if at any time ſhee had heard any thing of him.</p>
            <p>To all which demaundes, eyther to pleaſe me, or els ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her opinion, aunſwering the truth, it was a great comfort to my deſolate minde. And thus many times I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away the greater part of the day with leſſe gréefe &amp; ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. I tooke no leſſe pleaſure and content (then in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forſaide things) to viſit the holy Temples,<note place="margin">Variety of talke doth diminiſh ſorrow and ſadnes.</note> and to ſitte at my Pallace Gate with other Gentlewomen of my acquaintance, where often times with ſundrie diſcourſes, my infinite cares were ſomewhat remooued from mee. To which places ſometimes reſorting, it fell out often, that I ſawe dyuers of thoſe yong Gentlemen, whom I did knowe to kéepe <hi>Panphilus</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: and whenſoeuer I eſpied them, I did neuer forgette to looke amongſt them, if happilie I might ſée <hi>Panphilus</hi> wyth them, as ſometimes I did. O how often times was I vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deluded with this fooliſh imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And although I was thus deceiued, yet it did me much good to ſée them, whom (as by their pittifull countenaunces they bewrayed as much) I ſawe full of like compaſſion, that I had, in ſéeing themſelues alone (as it were) and depriued of their ſwéete companion, and who (me thought) ſéemed not halfe ſo merry, as they were wont to be.</p>
            <p>Ah what a great deſire had I many times to aſke them, what was become of their gentle friende and aſſociate, if rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon and modeſty had not counterchecked my eagre wil here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But Fortune truely was ſometimes fauourable to mée herein, becauſe in talking of him in ſuch like places, &amp; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I did not heare and vnderſtand them, they ſaid, that his returne was almoſt at hand: &amp; howe ſwéete theſe words were to myne eares, it were a booteleſſe labour to expreſſe. In this ſorte therefore, and with ſuch ſundry thoughtes and ſuperſtitious déedes, and with many other, like theſe, I dyd ſtudie to paſſe the tedious daies away, which were ſo yrke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to mée in their length, deſiring therefore ſtil for night, not becauſe of bothe I thought it more profitable or comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for me, but becauſe when it was come, there was the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2998:39"/> more time ſpent, and the leſſe to paſſe away. After that the comberſome day therefore (whoſe long howers being fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) gaue place to ſilent night, freſh fancies and new cares came alſo in company with the ſame. And I, who from my cradle béeing naturally giuen to bee afraide in the ſolitarye darknes of night, accompanied nowe with mighty loue,<note place="margin">Loue doth aſſure Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in darknes,</note> was frée from all manners of feare. And perceiuing euery one in my houſe to take their quiet reſt, ſometimes I went vppe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to that place, where I had not long ſince ſéene the Sun ryſing in the morning, and as <hi>Aronces</hi> did ſpeculate the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall bodies, and their orbiculer motions, betwéene the white Marbles in the hylles of <hi>Luca,</hi> ſo did I (the night crée<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping on with ouerlong minuts, and féeling the great cares, and carefull thoughts to be enemies vnto my wiſhed ſléepe) beheld the Heauens from that place, and the ſwift reuoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, imagining with my ſelf, that they were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſlow in their courſe: and ſometimes turning mine eyes ſtedfaſtly towardes the horned Moone, (hauing recourſe to her wayne, and to her roundnes, I perceiued by the increaſe and decreaſe of it, ſome nights to be longer and ſhorter then other. And ſo much the more my deſire was made more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, by how much ſooner I wyſhed, that the foure months by her ſwéete courſe had béene brought to an ende. Oh howe many times (although it lent a dimmed and obſcure lyght) did I beholde it a great while together with greate delight, imagining that my <hi>Panphilus</hi> his eyes were then fixed on it as well as mine. Whom for all that I doo not nowe doubt that (I béeing nowe quite out of his memorie) hee didde not once care to looke on the Moone, but not hauing ſo much as a thought thereof, he did rather at that time of the night, take his reſt in his bedde.<note place="margin">Louers who expect the returne of their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, thinke euery houre to be lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then other,</note>
            </p>
            <p>And I remember, that agréeued at the ſlowneſſe of her courſe, with diuers ſoundes (following the olde and ancient errors of thoſe many yéeres agoe) I helped her forwarde in her ſlowe courſe, to grow to her full roundnes, to the which after that it was come, contented with her perfecte and full light, ſhe cared not (as it ſéemed) to diminiſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame againe,
<pb facs="tcp:2998:40"/> and to returne to her newe hornes, but to remaine ſtill in her rounde forme, albeit with my ſelfe I helde her excuſed for the ſame, eſtéeming her aboade more fauourable and gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tious with her ioyfull Mother, then deſirous to returne to the darke kingdoms of her infernall Huſband. But I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber wel, that the deuoute petitions &amp; earneſt prayers, which many times I offered vppe vnto her, to accelerate her eaſie and ſlowe pace, I turned nowe into threatning ſpéeches ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">O <hi>Phaebe</hi> an euill rewarder of thy deuout ſeruice done vnto thée, with pittifull prayers I labor to leſſen thy trauell and wearie iourney, but thou not eſtéeming the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with longe and ſlow tariaunce (iniurious to thy ſelfe and to mee) dooſt not care to encreaſe mine. And therefore if to the neceſſitye of my helpe, thou dooeſt not returne more by corned, thou ſhalt then perceiue me as ſlow in thy honors and ſacrifices, which I meane to offer vp vnto thée, as now I find thée care leſſe and ſlacke in thy duetye to the worlde. Why, dooſt not thou knowe, that the ſooner thou ſhalt foure times horned, and as manie times rounde, haue ſhewed thy lights to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall creatures, by ſo much the ſooner my <hi>Panphilus</hi> ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to me againe: who béeing once come backe, then as ſlowe or as ſwift as thou wilt thou maiſt runne out thy com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paſſe and circles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Truely that ſelfe ſame madnes, which did induce me to make ſuch prayers, that very ſame did ſo bereaue me of my ſelfe, that it made me ſometimes thinke, that ſhe (afraide of my threatnings) made greater haſte in her courſe onely for my pleaſure: and other times ſéeming not to care for me, to be more ſlow then ſhe was before. This often beholding on her, made me ſo ſkilfull in her nature and courſe, that, when ſhe was in her wayne, or in any part of heauen, or conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with any ſtarre, I might haue fully iudged and known howe much of the night hadde paſſed away, and howe much was to come.</p>
            <p>Bothe the Beares likewiſe (if ſhée had not appeared) did by long experience make me very ſkilfull and certaine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2998:40"/> Alas who would haue beléeued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue coulde haue taught mée ſuch Aſtrologie, a ſcience more fitte for fineſt witts, and profounde iudgments, and not for a troubled mind occupyed wyth his furie.</p>
            <p>When the heauens full of darkeſt clowdes and ouerrun with boyſterous and tempeſtious windes, and choaked with miſtie fogges, did from this place take my ſight away, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (if I had no other matters to buſie my ſelf withal) cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling my wayting Maydes and Gentlewomen together in my Chamber, I did my ſelfe tell (and to pleaſe my ſtraunge humour) wylled them alſo to recount diuers tales, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which the more they were elonged from the trueth (as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte parte ſuch kind of people are wont to tell) ſo much the more (me thought) they hadde greater force to driue away ſighes, and to make mee merry, who gaue diligent eare vnto them, ſo that ſometimes, notwithſtanding my melancholike fittes, I laughed a pace at them. And if perhappes ſuch fayned ieſts and inuented tales,<note place="margin">To haue company in miſerye doth make the greefe the lighter.</note> could not (as true matters) be iuſtly ſet downe in diuers fabulous Bookes, yet in ſerching out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers miſteries by them, and applying theſe with mine, and perceiuing my ſelfe to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany in my ſorowes, I paſſed the time away wyth leſſe gréefe. Neyther doo I know which of theſe was moſt gratious vnto me, to ſée the nights paſſed away and ſpent, or els (my mynde buſied about other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) to ſée the daies runne on and ſpent.</p>
            <p>But after that the foreſayde operations, and manye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deuiſes had occupyed my ſences for a good whyle, I went enforcing my ſelfe (as it were) to ſléepe, although I knewe it was but in vayne, and therefore went rather to lye downe to ſléepe. And beeing all alone in my bedde, and troubled wyth no rumours and noyſe, all thoſe thoughts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte: which in the day tyme hadde ſurſaulted mee, came nowe a freſhe to my mynde, and in deſpight of my ſelfe made mée wyth manie more arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate them againſt my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>And I wold many times haue entred into others, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing
<pb facs="tcp:2998:41"/> (alas) was not ſo eaſilye graunted vnto mee, but yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by very force leauing them, and lying on that ſide, where ſometimes my <hi>Panphilus</hi> was wont to lye, which place reſeruing yet (as it were) a ſwéete ſauour and ſent of his body, me thought my drowzie ſences therwith reuyued, and my minde greatly contented, I did call him ſoftly wyth my ſelfe, and (as though he had heard me indéede,) I dydde ſwéetely pray him, that he would returne quickly againe. I did after imagine,<note place="margin">Diuers thoughts of louers.</note> that he was come again, and fayning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friuolous things with my ſelfe, by one &amp; one mee thought I did tell them vnto him, and hee demaunding many of mee again, I did anſwere againe in his place: and ſometimes it happened, that carryed away with ſuch fooliſh thoughtes, I fell at laſt a ſléepe, which was ſometimes more pleaſant and more welcome to me then any watching &amp; waking, becauſe when I was awake, I did falſely ſuppoſe theſe imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But this, if it had endured but any ſmall time, did make them appeare no otherwiſe to my fancies, then if they hadde béene true indéede.

And is it true (ſwéete <hi>Panphilus</hi>) that thou art returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? Certes it is. For héere I haue thée. And then I kiſſed him againe. Mée thought that other times wyth great ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace I was walking with him vp and downe the ſea banks. And ſometimes my imagination was ſo ſtrong héerein, that I did affyrme it with my ſelfe ſaying. Well now I doo not dreame, that I haue him betwéene mine armes. O howe it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2998:41"/> gréeued me, when it came to paſſe, that my pleaſant drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and ſwéete ſléepe were both ended, which (going away) did continually carie that away, with them, which without any trouble or gréefe to him, I muſt néedes confeſſe did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe me. And although that I remained in great melancoly by remembring of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, liuing neuertheleſſe al the next day in good hope, I was ſomewhat content and eaſed, deſiring ſtill that night would quicklie drawe on, becauſe I might in my ſléepe enioy that, which waking I could not attaine to. And although my ſléepe did ſometimes yéelde mee ſuch néedy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, notwithſtanding it did not permitte mee to receiue ſuch dreames of pleaſure, mingled without much bitter and poyſoned galle of ſorrowe, becauſe many times (me thought) I ſawe him apparelled with ragged and forlorne garments, beſmeared all ouer (I know not) with what foule and blacke ſpottes and very pale and fearefull, as though hee had béene purſued of ſome cruell enemie, with ſhrikes and outcryes calling to me. Helpe me, Oh my <hi>Fiammetta,</hi> helpe me. Other tymes (me thought) I hearde diuers talke, and mutter of his death.</p>
            <p>And ſometimes theſe fantaſies of horror perced ſo farre into my minde, that (me thought) I ſawe him lie dead before me: and in many other vncouth and pittifull formes, ſo that it neuer came to paſſe, that my ſléepe was of more force, or greater then my gréefe. Wherefore ſodainely awaked, and knowing the vanitie of my dreame, as one contented yet but to haue dreamed theſe terrours and terrible daungers, I tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked the Goddes,<note place="margin">Things ſene in dreames are ſome times true or elſe figu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res of true thinges.</note> remaining yet ſome what troubled in minde and fearing that the thinges, which I had ſéene, if not in all, in parte at leaſt they had béene true, or elſe figures of true thinges to come. Neither I was content at any time or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the contrarietie of theſe (although I ſayd with my ſelfe, and heard of others that dreames were but vaine) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I did heare ſome newes of him, of the which I beganne now carefully and warely to enquier after. And in ſuch ſorte (as you haue heard fayre Ladyes) I paſſed away the tedious dayes and irkeſome nightes, attending one ſtill after other
<pb facs="tcp:2998:42"/> in their long courſe. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth is that the time of hys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed returne approching, I déemed it the beſt, and ſafeſt counſell to lyue merely in the meane time: by which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, my beautie (a little altered and decayed by reaſon of this long vnacquainted gréefe) might returne againe into her pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per place, becauſe at his arriuall, I might not ſéeme ill fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and not gratious in his ſight, and ſo might not (perhaps) pleaſe his deinty and curious eyes.</p>
            <p>Which was not harde for mée to doo, becauſe being ſince his departure, accuſtomed and well acquainted with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, it made mée endure and paſſe them away with verie little trouble or no payne at all. And beſides this, the néere hope of his promyſed returne made mée euery day féele a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more ioye, and content of mynde.

            <p>Nor no ſooner dyd my mynde (contracted earſt with moſt bitter and pynching gréefes) beginne to dilate and enlarge it ſelfe in ſuch a pleaſaunt and ioyfull life, but I became fayrer then euer I was before.

As it pleaſed therfore my

And ſéeing manie goodlie chaſes, and braue courſes there, reioycing euery ones heart to ſée them, did but a little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dimniſhing my ſorrowfull thoughtes, for when I ſawe any fayre flyght, or courſe, therewith all I preſently ſayde.</p>
            <p>O that thou werte héere <hi>Panphilus,</hi> to ſée this ſporte, as ſometimes thou wert. But (alas) hauing now vntill that poynt, ſomewhat ſuſtained, and with leſſe gréefe, endured the beholding, and with ſome ſmall relaxation of my paines, followed theſe paſtimes, by recording them nowe, and thus in my minde (ouercome as it were with ſecréet gréefe) I left them abruptly of, and let them all doo as they lyſted for mée.</p>
            <p>O howe many times doo I remember, that in theſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, my bended bowe, and arrowes did fall out of my handes, in handling of which, in pitching of nettes, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting houndes goe, or following them, there was not anie Nimphe that waited one <hi>Diana</hi> her traine, that did (I thinke) euer excell me.

            <p>But after that euery valley, hill and all the wyde plaines were thorowly trauerſed vppe and downe, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2998:60"/> laden with ſtore of praye, wée returned home to our pleaſaunt Pauilions, which often tymes wée found full of glée, and myrth by reaſon of ſundrie and diuers feaſtes made in them.</p>
            <p>Sometimes afterwardes ſitting vnder the hollow dens, and entryes of hygh Rockes, that did with their crooked bodyes ouerhange the Sea, and with freſhe ayre ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sandes, where tables being ſet and furniſhed with ſundrie ſortes of meates, in companie of many Ladyes and braue Gentlewomen wee made great cheere togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>From which againe we were not ſo ſoone riſen, but dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſwéete inſtrumentes ſounding melodious muſicke, the young Gentlemen and Gentlewomen in moſt braue or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der beganne to leade diuers ſtately and pleaſaunt daunces, in which I muſt néedes (though againſt my will) make one. But becauſe my melancolie minde was not delyghted with them, and that the weakeneſſe of my bodie did alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the ſame, I daunced but a meaſure or two, and ſatte me downe againe. And with drawing my ſelfe behynd all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt amongeſt the cloathes of Tapiſtrie and Arras that were ſpreade abroade, and hung vp I ſecretly ſayde to my ſelfe.

            <p>And in theſe places at the very ſame time giuing a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eare to the ſkilfull muſicke, and the ſiluer ſoundes of of thoſe inſtrumentes, which with paſſing ſwéete notes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred déepely into my mynde, and thinking of my <hi>Panphilus</hi> I dyd at one tyme couer and hyde, diſcorde, feaſts and gréefe becauſe liſtening to the pleaſaunt noyſe made, euery demy deade ſpyrite of looue dyd regaine theyr former vigour, and force in mée againe: and the remembraunce of thoſe merrie times dyd returne againe to my minde, in whych the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly harmony of theſe inſtruments, touched with rare ſkil was wont in preſence of my <hi>Panphilus</hi> to worke diuers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and ſwéete effectes. But ſéeing not my <hi>Panphilus</hi> there, with moſt ſorrowfull teares and ſighes I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye
<pb facs="tcp:2998:61"/> haue complayned on them, if it hadde beene lawfull for me in that place. And beſides this the ſundrie Sonnets ſung of many young Gentlewomen there (excéeding the Nightingales in ſweete notes) were wont in my ioyfull times to delight my happie minde, of the which, if there was any (peraduenture) that did pleaſe my melancolicke humanes, I gaue moſt attentiue eare vnto the ſame, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring greatly to haue it, becauſe rehearſing and ſinging it afterwardes to my ſelfe, I might openly and with leſſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect after a modeſt kind of ſort, learne couertly to mourne, and ſecréetly to ſorrowe with my ſelfe, with thoſe gréefes eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, that were contained in it.</p>
            <p>But after that the reiterated daunces and roundes had wearied the young Gentlewomen, euery one beganne to place themſelues amongſt vs, and (as it was no rare thing there to ſée the amorous young Gentlemen thronging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout vs, did encompaſſe vs in manner of a crowne, whych thing neuer happened there, or any where elſe, that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but it made me call to minde that fatall day, when <hi>Panphilus,</hi> ſtanding behinde a fayre knote of younge Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, entrapped mée with the vertues of his diuine gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Wherfore I lifted vp myne eyes many times in vaine, prying and looking betwéene them, being fondlie perſwaded by my fooliſh conceite, that I ſhould in lyke manner haue ſéene my <hi>Panphilus</hi> amongeſt them here.</p>
            <p>Wherefore caſting mine eyes ſometimes amongſt them I marked howe ſome of them with eger lookes, and pyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull glaunces dyd beholde the amiable obiectes of theyr chéefeſt deſyres.</p>
            <p>And my ſelfe waxed by this time very cunninge in thoſe amorous daliaunces, with a perplexed eye dyd viewe euery one, and note euery thinge, they dyd, and perceyued well, who looued in déede, and who ieſted in demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſometymes commending one for the grace, that hee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in hys diſcourſe, and ſometymes an other for the prettie inuention hee vſed, and for hys amorous argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes ſo well couched togeather in his loouing ſtintes:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2998:61"/> ſaying to my ſelfe,<note place="margin">After a known er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour one wexeth wiſe at length</note> that my miſerable eſtate and curſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had béene much better, if I had then plaid the counter fette, as nowe they did, reſeruing thereby a frée ſoule to my ſelfe, as with dallying and ſporting they did kéepe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Afterwardes refelling ſuch an opinion, I ſayd. <q rend="margQuotes">Nay I am rather content (if in poſſeſſing an euill there is any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at all) to haue loued faithfully.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Returning therefore with mine eyes and thoughts to the wanton behauiour, and amorous actions of theſe yonge Louers, I reaped ſome ſmall comforte by their ſundry fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And when I did perceiue that any of them didde loue more feruently then the reſt, I did more commend with my ſelfe ſuch well meaning Louers.

            </p>
            <p>And hauing thus ſaide, I helde my peace, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to note thoſe countenaunces, geſtures &amp; actions, with which theſe louing Nouices, profeſſed Louers,<note place="margin">No feaſt de lighteth where the thing belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued is not ſeene.</note> and retyred Souldiours did diuerſly ſtudie to pleaſe their dainty Ladies and Gentlewomen.

But ſome more pittifull then the reſt, marking my mildnes, and iudging it (as it was indéede) but a certaine gréefe of minde, with taking great compaſſion of me, laughed at that which the reſt both dyd, and ſayd. And viſited thus of many, I remained euery day more amazed then other: And vnder the diſcrete garde of the ſage Nource I was cloſely kept.

            <p>To ſende the Nurce thether, I thought it as farre from the purpoſe, becauſe I dyd apparauntly perceiue, that ſhée could neuer come to him aliue, and to put my affiaunce and truſt in an other, I thought it to preiudiciall to my honour and honeſty.

            <p>I thought ſometimes to take the habite of a Pilgrime, and with ſome faithfull companion and ſecrete fréende, to ſéeke him out in the very middeſt of his countries.

And beſides this, knowinge my ſelfe obliged to my good huſband, without whome, or his leaue, I could not conceiue how to frame, or how to take in hand this long iournie, which thing to obtaine, in vaine I might haue hoped. Wherefore I gaue no place to this boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe inuention.

            <p>And if I was perhaps called into the houſe, or els by ſome other vrgent occaſion went from the windowe, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand thoughts (as if a multitude of dogs grinding their téeth at me, had bitte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſoule) did ſting and moleſt me ſaying to my ſelfe. <q rend="margQuotes">Alas euen now (perhaps) he goeth by, or els is already paſſed, whilſt thou art héere buſied about not ſo contented an office:</q> and immediatly I went againe to ſée if I coulde ſée him come,<note place="margin">Reade Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſto of her that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of her Louer.</note> making it but a ſhort time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene going downe to the dore, and running quickly vp to the window againe. Ah poore ſoule, and wretched Woman, how much ſorrow and how many troubles diddeſt thou ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne for him, whom howrely looking for thou couldeſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer perceiue to come. But after that the day was come, in which my Nurce told mee, that he ſhould arriue, and of the which, ſhe had ſo often foretold me, I adorned my ſelfe no otherwiſe then <hi>Alcmena</hi> did, when ſhe heard that her <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitrio</hi> was at hande, and wyth my maſtering hand left not any thing in me vnbeautified, but ſette forth in the beſt and braueſt order, and in the fineſt faſhion.</p>
            <p>And I coulde ſcarce kéepe my ſelfe in, from going to the Sea ſyde, becauſe I myght the ſooner ſee hym, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (alſo) I hearde certaine newes of the arriual of thoſe Gallies, in the which my Nurce vnderſtood and certified me
<pb facs="tcp:2998:111"/> that he ſhould come. But thinking with my ſelfe, that the firſt Saint, that he would viſite on ſhoare was my ſelfe, I (therefore) bridled my earneſt and hote deſire. But in fine (as I rightlie geſſe) he came not at all: whereuppon I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne beyonde all meaſure to meruaile, and in the middes of my late ioye, ariſed in my minde diuers kinds of doubtes, which were not ſo eaſilie ouerthrowne by ſuperficicall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of his comming, or by any other ſhaddowes of glad ſome thoughts. After a little while therefore, I ſent the old Woman to know what was become of him, and whether he was come or not? who went as it ſéemed, with ſuch an vnwilling minde, and with as flow a pace, which did diuine of ſome conſequent and ſorrowfull tydinges. Wherefore I accurſed many times with my ſelfe, and with greate anger blamed her crooked ſteppes and aged paces. Who ſtaying but a little time abroade, came to me againe with a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full chéere, and dull gate.</p>

But after that my forſaken forces came to me againe, and after I had powred foorth many teares and ſighes, I aſked the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Nurce an other time, if it were ſo, as ſhe had ſayd. And beſides this, remembring with my ſelfe, howe warye and diſcrete <hi>Panphilus</hi> was wont to bee, and ſuſpecting that hee had wiſely and of purpoſe made himſelfe vnknowne to the Nurce, with whom he had neuer talked in his life before, I wylled, that ſhe ſhould deſcribe vnto me the countenaunce, the feyture, the geſture, the perſonage, and the faſhions of that <hi>Panphilus</hi> with whom ſhe had talked.

Wherof I thinke to reape a double commodity.</p>
            <p>Firſt in knowing my ſelfe not the firſt, nor to be alone afflicted with miſery, as not long ſince my Nurce, in her alleaged comfortes told me. Secondly, that euery gréefe, payne, and pange of their looue, being (in my iudgement) ſufficiently recompenced, I determined and reſolued with my ſelfe to paſſe away euer after with my former, euery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gréefe whatſoeuer: which I recken no little glory to me, when I may ſay, that I am onely ſhe, that liuing hath ſuſtained more gréefe and miſery then any other woman: And with this kinde of glorie (forſaken yet of euery one as extreame miſery indéede, and of my ſelfe (alas) if I could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe doo) in this ſorte as you ſhall heare, I paſſed away my melancholie times. I ſay therefore, that martired with theſe continuall anguiſhes and conſidering well of others who haue not béene exempted from the lyke, the painefull looues of <hi>Inacus</hi> his daughter (who being firſt a tender and delicate damſell, and paſſing loouely and beautifull, did ſéeme liuely to repreſent me) came to my minde, and afterwards, her great good happe and happy felicitie, in that ſhe was not meanely belooued of mightie <hi>Ioue.</hi> Which thing doubtleſſe cold not be of her onely but of euery woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo accompted a great glory and praiſe. Afterwardes conſidering howe ſhee was metamorphiſed into a Cowe, and how by the ſeuere commaunde of iealious <hi>Iuno,</hi> ſhe was kept of vigilant <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> I did iudge her to be beyond all meaſure torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with great anxieties and gréefe of mind. And certes I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that her gréefs did greatly excéede mine, if that for her company &amp; comfort ſhe had not had ſometimes the aſſiſtance of her loouing God. And who dooth doubt, if I had the ſwéete company of my loouer, who might any time haue helped me
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2998:114"/> in theſe ruthfull paſſions, or that he had but ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any little pittie of me, that any woes whatſoeuer coulde haue annoyed me ſo, as they haue continually doone? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des this, her ende made her paſſed and approoued ſorrowes, very light. Becauſe <hi>Argus</hi> being killed by her loouers meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, and ſhe tranſported lightly with her heauie body into <hi>Egipt,</hi> and returned there to her owne ſhape againe, and maryed to <hi>Oſtiris,</hi> ſhe ſawe her ſelfe at laſt inſtalled in the Emperiall diademe and like a happy Quéene to ſway the regal ſcepter of <hi>Egipt.</hi> If I could but thinke, or hope though in my olde age to ſée my <hi>Panphilus</hi> once againe, I would ſay that my gréefes were not to be compared with the ſorrowes of this Lady, But the Gods onely knowe, if this good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhall euer happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to me or no, howſoeuer with falſe hope in the meane time I delude and flatter my ſelfe.<note place="margin">The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of theſe fables are in Ouide.</note> Next to her the vnfortunate looue of <hi>Biblis</hi> is repreſented vnto my thoughts, whom (me thinke) I ſée forſake, all her wealth, ioy and pleaſure to followe vnflexible <hi>Caunus.</hi> And with theſe, I bethinke my ſelfe alſo of wicked <hi>Mirrha,</hi> who, after the deteſted fruition of her odious looues, flying from her angry Father, who purſued her with menaces of iuſt death, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged alſo into that miſery</p>
            <p>I behold alſo dolorus <hi>Canace,</hi> who, after the miſerable byrth of her inceſtious conceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, looked for nothing leſſe but death. And thinking well with my ſelfe of their ſeuerall ſor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rowes, I dyd doubtleſſe eſtéeme them to be extreame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their looues were but filthy and abhominable luſtes. But if I am not deceiued, I ſée them all ended, or elſe in ſhorte ſpace to be terminated. Becauſe <hi>Mirrha</hi> flying away, hauing the Goddes pittifull of her paines, and aunſwerable to her deſires, was with delay tranſformed into a trée of her owne name.</p>
            <p>And ſhee neuer after (although it dooth continually deſtill Amber teares, as ſhee dyd at the very inſtant, when her forme was changed) felte any of her former paynes and playntes. And as the occaſion of her ſorrowes dyd aryſe, ſo the cauſe of theyr pryuation, was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb facs="tcp:2998:115"/> wanting. <hi>Biblis</hi> likewiſe (as ſome ſay) without any longer delay ended her dolefull daies with a cruell halter, ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitte, that others holde, that by great fauour of the Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes, (who did commiſſerate her harde deſtinies) ſhe was turned into a fountaine of her owne name, till this day yet kéeping the ſame.</p>
            <p>And this befell to her when ſhe knew that <hi>Caumus</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, her deſires, and ſcornefully reiected her companie, and with frowning browes reprooued her wicked ſutes. What ſhal I ſay in ſhewing my owne paines, greater (alas) then thoſe, that moleſted <hi>Biblis,</hi> &amp; more gréeuous, then thoſe, that <hi>Mirrha</hi> had, but that the breuiety of them hath had no ſmall aduantage ouer the length of mine. Thoſe therefore well conſidered, the pittifull looues of hapleſſe <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe</hi> were next obiected to my remembraunce, of whome (I cannot but take great compaſſion, imagining them both to be young and with great trouble, &amp; many ſorowes to haue burned in each others looue, and labouring with mutuall preſence to haue reaped the fruite of theyr feruent deſires, which with vntimely death and in ſhorte time were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diſſolued.</p>
            <p>O what a pittifull thing is it to thinke, what gréefe pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced poore <hi>Pyramus</hi> his hart, when, in the ſilent time of night finding his déere <hi>Thisbes</hi> robes, bloody and torne of the wild beaſt at the foote of the Mulbery trée, néere vnto the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine and appointed méeting place, by theſe diſmall &amp; vnexpected tokens, he ſurely thought that ſhe was deuoured. The ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certes of his own ſword in his inpatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t breaſt did ſhew it manifeſtly enough. Afterwards diſcourſing in my minde the wounding thoughtes of miſerable <hi>Thisbe,</hi> beholding her loouer wallowing in his owne goare, and pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting yet with de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clining life, I thinke them to be ſo gréeuous, and imagine her teares alſo to be ſuch burning droppes, that I can hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie beléeue that there were euer any (myne owne excepted) that dyd torment, and ſcalde more, then hyrs. Wherefore theſe two (as it is now ſayd) in the very beginning of theyr gréefes, and looues dyd ende the very ſame. O thriſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2998:115"/> happy ſoules, if that in the other world, as in this their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and firme looue dooth, ſtill remaine inuiolate. And ſo, the paynes, cares and infinite woes, of all theyr former looue could not be equiualent with the delightes, and content of their eternall company.</p>
            <p>After theſe the gréefe of forſaken <hi>Dido</hi> entred with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force and déeper conſideration into my minde, becauſe her condition did of all others moſt reſemble mine. I imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how ſhe was building of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and ſtudying with great Maieſty to dictate lawes in <hi>Iunos</hi> temple, to her new people: And how ſhe gaue bountifull entertainment to <hi>Aene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> a ſtraunger vnto her, by enuious tempeſts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therbeaten, and caſt vpon her <hi>Libian</hi> ſhores, and how ſhe was enamoured of his braue perſonage, and paſſing vertues and at laſt howe ſhe committed both her ſelfe, and all hirs to the diſpoſition and pleaſure of that <hi>Troyan</hi> Duke. Who hauing vſed her royall Pallaces at his pleaſure, and ſoaked himſelfe in all manner of delices in her countrie, ſhe being euery day more and more enflamed with his looue, abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her at laſt, departed from thence. O how much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compare did ſhe ſéeme miſerable in my conceite, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her looking from her higheſt turrettes towards the ſea, couered with diſankred ſhippes of her flying and vnpittifull loouer.</p>
            <p>But I iudge her more impatient, then dollorous, when I thinke of her cruell death. And certes at the firſt departure of my <hi>Panphilus</hi> I felt (in my oppinion) the very ſelfe ſame gréefe, as ſhe did on the ſodaine endure, at the ſayling away of falſe <hi>Aeneas.</hi> O that it had ſo pleaſed the Goddes that I, as vnable to endure my gréefe, as ſhe was hers, had with ſome ſodaine death ended my loathed life, ſo that by theſe meanes I might haue deliuered my ſelfe from theſe paines, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, as ſhe dyd her ſelfe, which afterwardes (by defaulte thereof) dyd continually cleaue in ſunder my afflicted hart. After theſe miſerable thoughtes, and the ruthfull chaunces of vnhappy <hi>Heroe</hi> of <hi>Seſto</hi> came to my minde, whome (mee thought I ſawe comming downe from her higheſt Tower
<pb facs="tcp:2998:116"/> to the Sea bankes and rockes, where ſhe was wont ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to méete and receiue her welbelooued and wearied <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ander</hi> into her armes.</p>
            <p>And euen there againe (mée thinks) I ſe her w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what a pit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifull &amp; pale countenance ſhe beheld her loouer lying dead be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore her,<note place="margin">Sorrow cea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth when hope is paſt to regaine the thing which is loſt,</note> driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt on ſhore by a fréendly <hi>Dolphin,</hi> al naked, &amp; ſouced in briniſh waters, &amp; laid along vpon the Sea ſands, &amp; wiping with her garmentes the ſalte water from his pale viſage, and drowning hym the ſecond time with the flowing ſtreames of her ſwelling teares. Ah what great pittie dooth her cruell paſſages finde in my ſorrowfull mind. More true<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie then any of thoſe of the foreſayd ladyes, and ſometimes ſo much, that forgetting my owne woes, I did wéepe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for hirs.</p>
            <p>And laſtly cold I conceiue no meanes for her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort but one of theſe two, either to die, or elſe to forget him, as other dead men haue béene: In taking eyther of which her ſorrowes (I thinke) might haue eaſilie béene finiſhed. Conſidering that no loſt thing, in recouering of which againe, there is no hope lefte, can gréeue vs any long time. But yet the Goddes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde, that this kinde of comfort ſhould happen to me, which if it did come to paſſe, no counſel in ſuch a caſe ſhould auaile but that, which perſwaded me once to a reſolute and haſty death. For during the time that my <hi>Panphilus</hi> liueth, whoſe lyfe his happie ſtarres, and predominante planettes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue as long, as he himſelf dooth deſire, that cannot (I hope) nor ſhall not befall vnto me. But ſéeing the enter courſe of mundane thinges in continuall motion, this beléefe is added to my hope, that in the end, or elſe (perhappes) before, he ſhall returne, and be mine againe, as once he was: which linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hope not comming to effect, dooth howerly make my life gréeuous and irkeſome vnto mée. And by thus much ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, I eſtéeme my ſelfe oppreſſed with greater ſorrowe then ſhe was. I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in French méeters, to which if any cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dite may be lent, I haue ſometimes read that Sir <hi>Triſtram,</hi> and Lady <hi>Iſotta</hi> haue more then any other loouers,<note place="margin">French Rimes,</note> mutually
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2998:116"/> and feruentlie looued each other, and with their chaunging delightes, haue had great miſfortunes and aduerſities enter mingled, euen in the flooriſhing and braueſt time of theyr youth, who, becauſe, loouing greatly togeather, they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted both of one ende, it ſéemes moſt credible, that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extreame ſorrowe and bitter gréefe on bothſides, they forſooke their worldly delightes.</p>
            <p>Which may be eaſilie graunted, if in abandoning this world they thought that in the other, the ſame could not bée found or had. But if they had this opinion, that they were as ample and common in the other (as they had in déede) then it is to be thought, that death had rather aforeded them ſome great content and ioy, then any ſorrow and feare at all. For what certaintie of gréefe may one giue with teſtimonie of a thing, which he neuer prooued. None at all truely. In Syr <hi>Triſtram</hi> his armes was his owne death, and the death of hys Lady alſo.</p>
            <p>For if, in embracing her body ſo ſtraightly and loouingly it had gréeued her at all, in opening his armes againe, the payne (no doubt) had ceaſed. And yet for all this, let vs admit and ſay, that it is by great reaſon moſt fearefull, and grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to taſt of: what gréefe can wée ſay to be abſolutely in a thing, that dooth come to paſſe but onely once, and which dooth occupie but a little ſpace of time? Certes none. Sir <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtram</hi> therfore &amp; <hi>Iſotta</hi> in one hower ended their delightes, &amp; dollours. The continued time of my ſtretching gréefe, and laſting ſorrowe, hath without compariſon greatly excéeded the breuitie of my enioyed myrth and ioyes. But amongeſt the number of theſe foreſayd loouers, my minde did thinke of miſerable <hi>Phedra,</hi> who with her voluntary and aduiſed furie, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occaſion of his moſt cruel death, whom ſhe loued more then her ſelfe: &amp; I knowe not truely, what dammage &amp; great inconuenience did follow her of ſuch a great fault, but I am certaine, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like had euer happened to me, there had bene nothing but violent death, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might expiate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> guilt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but if ſhe liued, ſhe buried him afterward in darck obliuio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as
<pb facs="tcp:2998:117"/> commonly all thinges (as euen now I ſayd) are wont to bée forgotten by death. And beſides theſe ſorowes which <hi>Laoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Deiphyle Argia, Euadne,</hi> &amp; <hi>Deianira,</hi> and many others felte, followed hers in my ſcanning thoughts: all which ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by violent death, or by neceſſary obliuion receiued ſome comfort at laſt.</p>

Wherefore all theſe foreſayd woes, in reſpect of mine, haue béene but amorous annoyaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces. But beſides theſe miſerable women, the no leſſe ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful teres powred forth of thoſe, who w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vnexpected brunts of cruell fortune haue béene confounded, came before mine eyes.</p>
            <p>And theſe are thoſe of <hi>Iocaſta, Hecuba, Sophonisba, Corne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lia</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> O how much myſerie (conſidering well the miſerable ſucceſſe of <hi>Iocaſtas</hi> looues) doo we ſée befallen vnto her in all her life time, poſſible enough to haue daunted and troubled the moſt ſtout and ſtrongeſt minde. For ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very young, was maried to <hi>Layus</hi> King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who commaunded, that her firſt childe ſhould be throwen out to be deuowred of wilde Beaſtes, the miſerable Father thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by this, to haue preuented that which the heauens and his ineuitable deſtinies, with infallible courſe had prepared for him. O what a gréefe muſt (I néedes thinke,) that this was to her ſoule, conſidering the degrée of her that ſente it, and that with her owne handes ſhe was conſtrained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer, and to ſende it to a cruell kinde of death: and afterwar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des certified by them, that caried her vnfortunate infante, of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2998:117"/> his mangled and deuoured corpes, with what intollerable gréefe ſhe beléeued, that he was deade indéede. And to ſee her hapleſſe Huſband moſt miſerably ſlaine of him, whom hee had engendred in her owne bowels, and that ſhe her ſelfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards eſpouſed to her vnknowne Son, had by him foure children. And ſo how almoſt in one howre ſhe ſawe her ſelfe mother, and wife to this wicked <hi>Parricide:</hi> whom after ſhée had perfectly knowne, when ſhe ſawe him depriued firſt of his eyes, and laſt of his kingdom, and how his execrable fact and deteſted life was publiſhed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole worlde. In what miſerable plight her ſoule was then, oppreſſed nowe wyth manie yéeres, which were rather deſirous of repoſe, then méete to be diminiſhed with reſtles anguiſh, ſhee may well thinke, and iudge, who hath béene toſſed with the greateſt, or with like gréefes of minde. But yet her diſpiteous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Fortune heaped vppon her extreame miſery, greater and more bitter woes. For ſéeing the yéerely entercourſe &amp; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue raigne of her two Sonnes, with mutuall compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deuided betwéene them. And afterwardes the faithleſſe brother pynned vppe in the Cittie, and ſéeing the greateſt part of <hi>Greece</hi> vnder the regiment of ſeauen Kings, laſtly, after manie blooddie battailes, conſuming fires, myſerable ſpoyle of Virgins, wiues, and goods. When ſhee behelde one of her prodigious Sons vnnaturally to embrew his ſworde in his owne brothers blood, and when her Huſbands Sonne driuen out, and exiled into an other Kingdome, ſhe ſawe the auncient and olde walles of her noble Cittie builded firſte by the ſwéete harmonie of <hi>Amphitrion</hi> his Cythern, pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie ruinated and beaten downe. And howe her late flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing kingdome was miſerably diuided and vtterlie diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and hauing hanged her ſelfe, left perhaps her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a moſt ignominous and ſhamefull life. What coulde the angry Goddes, the world, froward Fortune, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Hagges of hell haue conſpired more againſt her. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certes in my opinion.</p>
            <p>For let that gaſtly place be ſurueyed, and euery torture therein duelie conſidered, and yet I hardlie beléeue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there
<pb facs="tcp:2998:118"/> coulde not in the ſame ſuch extreame torments and paines be founde. Wherefore I approoue and ſay, that euery &amp; leaſt particle of her anguiſh, and of her fault to be moſt gréeuous, and no leſſe impious. And as there is no woman that would iudge, that my gréefe were not to be compared to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this, ſo (truely) would I alſo ſay, had not mine béene amorous.</p>
            <p>For who doubteth but that ſhe knewe, (ſéeing the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable crymes of her wicked houſe, and of vnnaturall Huſband (worthy of the condigne anger of the Goddes) that duely ſcanned theſe aduerſe accidents) theſe horrible acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to be meritorious puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for ſuch heynous guilt, and barbarous impietie. None truely, that would iudge her to be in her right witts. And if ſhe were but a foole ſhee felt her gréefes the leſſe, becauſe (not fully knowing the waight of them) they could not ſo greatly gréeue her. And whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knoweth her ſelfe woorthy of ſuch calamities &amp; troubles that ſhe endureth, with little gréefe or none at all, ſhee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth with her ſelfe more patientlie to paſſe them away. But I neuer committed anie thing, wherewith the Gods might iuſtly be offended with me, hauing with continual offerings honored them, and with holy victimie beſought their diuine graces, neuer deſpyſing their Godheads, as in times paſt the <hi>Thebanes</hi> moſt wickedly did. But perhappes ſome one may well obiect and ſay. Howe canſt thou affirme, that thou haſt not deſerued puniſhment, or that thou haſt not committed anie fault? Why, haſt thou not violated the holy lawes, and with an adulterous youthe defiled thy marriage bedde? yes truely.</p>
            <p>But if this matter bee well propounded, as I haue not my ſelfe onely doone thys cryme, ſo dooth it not deſerue (I thinke) ſo greate puniſhment, and ſuch gréeuous paynes. Becauſe ſhée muſt thinke, that I being a tender yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, was not able to gaineſaye and reſiſte that, which the ſtrongeſt menne in the world, nay the Gods themſelues coulde not doo.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:2998:118"/>
            <p>And as I am not the firſt, that hath committed ſuch a fréendly fault, ſo am I not alone, and ſhall not bee the laſte, but hauing almoſt all Women in the worlde my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this excuſable errour, I am not ſo greatly to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for the ſame. And thoſe lawes which I haue infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, are of common courſe wont fauourably to pardon a mul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>My fault moreouer, as it was moſt ſecrete, ſo it ſhoulde not therefore be ſo ſeuerely and thorowlie puniſhed.<note place="margin">A ſecrete fault is halfe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</note> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, Say that the Goddes were iuſtly ſtirred vppe to wrath againſt mee, and did ſeeke to giue mée ſharpe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for my great offences, were it not a greater parte of iuſtice, and more reaſon to puniſh him, who was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my fall? Nowe whither burning and lawles loue,<note place="margin">He that is the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne ought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely to be puniſhed.</note> or <hi>Panphilus</hi> his rare beauty, braue perſonage, and quallities induced me to corrupt the ſacred lawes of wedlock, I know not, but knowing too too well, that both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were of moſt great force to torment me moſt ſtranglie. So that this nowe did not happen by the ſinne committed, but is rather a newe gréefe and ſequeſtred from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt more cruelly cruciating the patient and ſuſtayner of it, then anie other.</p>
            <p>The which moreouer, if the Goddes for my commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted offence had giuen me, they ſhoulde doo contrary to theyr right iudgment and accuſtomed manner, in that they ſhould not with the ſinne recompence the puniſhment, which bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared to the due paynes of <hi>Iocaſta,</hi> and to her deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued defaults, and conſidering mine owne errors, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere puniſhment, which I doo ſuffer for the ſame, ſhee muſt néedes be ſaide to be but ſlightly puniſhed, and my ſelfe with too rigorous chaſtiſement, and vnmeaſurable paine, to be cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rected. Nor let not any take holde of this, that ſhee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued of her Kingdome, depryued of her Sonnes, deſpoyled of her Huſband, and laſt of all, of her owne life, and I but onely of my Louer. All which truely I confeſſe.</p>
            <p>But ſpyghtful Fortune caryed away with this Louer, all my felicitie, though that, (which perhappes in other
<pb facs="tcp:2998:119"/> mens ſight and iudgment was accounted happines) hath ſtil remained with me, and which is cléene contrarie to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Becauſe my Huſband, my parents, my riches, and all things els beſides are a moſt gréeuous burden vnto mée, and nothing congruant with my wiſhed content. Which things if ſhe had taken from me, as ſhe did my Louer, there had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remained a moſt open way for me to haue fulfilled my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, which vndoubtedly I would haue followed. By which if I could not haue brought to paſſe my wil, then were there a thouſand kinds of deathes readie for me, to haue rydde me from all my woes and miſeries. Wherefore I iuſtly thinke that my paines are much more greater, then any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaide.</p>

            <p>But the preſent hope of that, which after happened, made her to paſſe it ouer more lightly.

But afterwards forſaken of him, there are who think, that for gréefe of theſe croſſing cares, her tender hartſtringes did well nie break a ſunder, not regarding that there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine touch of vnconſtancie, &amp; breach of loue, as wel in her, as in him, which at both their pleaſures they did forſake, and take from one another, and beſtowe it els where, as often times ſhe plainely ſhewed, how fitly ſhe could doo the ſame. But the Gods forbid, that ſuch conſolation befal to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe and afflicted ſoule. For he was neuer yet, or euer ſhall be, beſides him, to whom by many deſertes I haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowed the whole terme and trauaile of my life, that coulde affyrme, or yet can ſay, that I was euer his, but in hart affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anced onely to <hi>Panphilus,</hi> and whoſe I wyll for euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</p>
            <p>Nor let him hope, whoſoeuer he be, that any other loue ſhall neuer be of ſuch force as to driue his out of my faithful breaſt.

Becauſe if ſhe were on the one ſide agréeued at his departure, the ioy on the other, and the comfort that ſhe receiued of her lyttle Sonne <hi>Caeſarionem</hi> which ſhe had by him, and of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome reſtored to her againe, counteruayling her gréefe, nay, excéeding all her former ſorrowes whatſoeuer, did yéelde her treble conſolation. This ioy hath force and ſtrength enough to ouercome greater anguiſhe, and more extreame cares of mind, then thoſe of them, who loue but a little, and that but coldly to (as euen now I ſaide) that ſhe did. But that, which for the accompliſhment of her greateſt gréefe, was annexed to the reſt, was, that ſhe was the wyfe of <hi>Marke Antonie,</hi> whom ſhee had with her libydinous entiſements ſtyrred vp to ciuill, nay vnciuill warres againſt her owne brother, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyring thereby and hoping (by the victory of them) to haue béene

And conſidering truely ſo high a mynde, and ſo prowde a conceite, which to be firſt in imagination and afterwardes in indéede ſole and ſoueraigne Ladie and Quéene of the whole circuite of the earth, by one infortunate battaile to be daſhed, and caſt downe (our ſex alſo being naturally giuen to aſpyre and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination) beſids the foyle of the conquered, &amp; the triumph of the victor, and beſides this the loſſe alſo of ſo déere and braue a huſband, it cannot be otherwiſe apprehended, but that it was a wonderful corſiue to her noble heart and an extreme torment of her diſmayed ſoule.</p>
            <p>But ſodanely ſhe found out a wholeſome medicine, which did ſpéedely helpe and heale this mortall mallady, and that was a ſtraung kinde of death. Which (although for the tyme it was very cruell and ſharpe) was not for all that, in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any long time a dooing: Becauſe in one little hower, two venomous vipers may at the pappes of a you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der woman ſucke out both blood and life, as they did out of miſerable <hi>Cleopatras</hi> breſt.</p>
            <p>O how many times would I haue doon the like, although for a leſſer occaſion according to the opinion of many, if I had béene peremtorilie forſaken, or if for feare alſo of enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infamie thereof, I hadde not withdrawen my ſelfe.</p>

Thoſe of <hi>Theiſtes</hi> and of <hi>Tereus,</hi> bothe which were the miſerable Sepultures of their owne Sons, were obiected to my memorie. And I maruel what vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and forced patience (fearing their inward bitinges) and what pittileſſe reſtrainte did moderate thoſe ſauage Sires from launching theyr ſides, and with ſlicing kniues to make way for their Sonnes ſtrugling in theyr paternall bowels, and ſtriuing to come foorth, abominating that wretched place into which they were ſo rauenouſly gulfed. But theſe alſo burſt out, &amp; (with that they could) choaked at once theyr hatred and gréefe togeather, and ſo tooke in a manner a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine comforte in theyr harmes, perceiuing that without faulte they were accounted miſerable men but of theyr peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that which happened not to mée.</p>
            <p>For I haue compaſſion borne me of that, which did neuer gréeue mee, and dare not diſcouer that whych dooth moſt of all afflicte me, which thing if I durſt doo, I doubt not, but as others in my miſerable caſe haue found out ſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for theyr paynes,<note place="margin">Lycurgus,</note> ſo might I (perhappes) finde out ſome eaſe and helpe as well as they. The pittifull teares of <hi>Licur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and of his houſe, (iuſtly powred foorth for dead <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous</hi> killed of the Serpent,) come alſo ſometimes to my minde, and accompanied with the continuall ſighes of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful <hi>Atalanta</hi> mother of <hi>Parthenopaeus</hi> killed in the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane</hi> Campes,<note place="margin">Atalanta.</note> which came ſo properly and ſo néerely to mée with theyr effectes, that I could ſcarce conceyue any greater then them in my minde, If had not prooued them my ſelfe, I ſay, that they were full of ſuch great ſorrowe, that they could not be more.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:2998:122"/>
            <p>But euery one of them are with ſo high glory eterniſhed, that they might bée eſtéemed in a manner merry accidents, then mornefull ſtratagems, The ſorrowfull teares (of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> I meane) with the mortall exequies, honoured of the ſeauen kinges, and infinite ſportes and ſpectacles made by them in ſolemnization of that glorious funerall, and thoſe of <hi>Atalanta</hi> made notable and beutified alſo with the laudable life, and victorious death of her young Sonne.</p>
            <p>But I haue not any thing, nor any ſuch cauſe, to make my teares ſcarce well employed, much leſſe excellent, and my ſelfe content, becauſe if it were ſo wheras I now eſtéeme my ſelfe more dolefull and vnfortunate then any other, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes I ſhould be perſwaded to auerre the contrary.<note place="margin">Viliſſes.</note> The long trauelles of <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> his mortall and imminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilles, his wandering and weary perigrinations, and all his déedes whatſoeuer are next of all ſhewed vnto mée, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taſted them, but ſeaſoned with moſt bitter and extreame anguiſhe of minde, and redoubled many times in my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, they make me thinke mine to be farre greater and much more gréeuous, and harken why. Becauſe firſt and principally, he was a manner, and therefore of nature more ſtrong, and better able to endure them, then I, being a tender and young woman, and he béeing moreouer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie armed with a ſtoute, couragious, and feirce mynde, and beaten to dailie daungers as one rypened amongeſt them, when hee trauailed, and turmoyled, dyd ſéeme to haue but his ordinary, repoſe, nay his greateſt eaſe and pleaſure in them.</p>
            <p>But I béeing continually in my Chamber, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſerued with daintie and delicate thinges, paſſing my times awaie in pleaſures, and dailie accuſtomod to dallian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wanton looue, euery little payne, and feare thereof is moſt gréeuous vnto me.</p>
            <p>He driuen, and pricked on by <hi>Neptune,</hi> and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into diuers partes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of world, and of <hi>Aeolus</hi> likewiſe receyued his troubles.</p>
            <p>But with careful looue I am infected, and with ſuch a lord <pb facs="tcp:2998:123"/> infeſted, that troubled and conquered them, that moleſted and toſſed <hi>Vliſſes.</hi> And if daungerous caſualties, and daylie feares dyd ſéeme to threaten him, of his proper accorde hée wandered continually in ſéeking of them out.

            <p>Beſides this, he was not afrayd of death, and therefore without feare did commit him ſelfe to her force and might. But I liue in continuall dreade of it, though compelled by extreame ſorrowe I haue ſometime (not without feare of greater gréefe) runne willingly vnto it. He alſo by his long trauelles and ieopardies of Fortune dyd hope to get eternal glorie, and neuer dying fame: But I am afrayd of my eſcan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dilized name, and infamous memory hereafter, if it ſhoulde come to paſſe that theſe ſecrete looues ſhould at any tyme come to lyght.</p>
            <p>So that now his paynes are not greater and more then myne, but are rather in number and quallitie farre leſſe then mine, and by ſo much the more, as they are fabulated to be greater then euer they were indéede. But mine (alas) are to true, ſo many, and more greater, then I am able my ſelfe to recounte. But after all theſe, I ſée (me thinkes) the ſorrowes, ſobbes and heauie ſighes, the infinite woes, and pit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tious plaints, that <hi>Hipſiphile, Medea,</hi> and <hi>Oenone</hi> had, and the pittifull teares of <hi>Ariadne</hi> which were more copious then all the reſt: all which I iudge moſt like vnto mine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery one of theſe (lyke my ſelfe) deceiued of their loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, watred the ground with teares, cléeued the heauens with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall ſighes, &amp; ſuſtained without any frute, or hope of future content, moſt bitter tormentes of mynde. And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit (as it is graunted) that theſe dolours were caſt vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their vngrateful loouers, and by theyr iniurious and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued ingratitude, yet with iuſt reuenge of their wronges
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2998:123"/> doone vnto them, they ſawe the ende of theyr teares: which comfortes (although I wiſhe it not) my ſorrowes alſo haue not. <hi>Hipſiphile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hipſiphile,</note> admitte that ſhe had greatly honoured <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and had by due deſertes obliged him vnto her, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him to be taken away of <hi>Medea,</hi> had with as great rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon as my ſelfe iuſt occaſion, of complaint and ſorrowe.</p>
            <p>But ſuch was the prouidence of the Goddes, that, with righteous eyes beholding euery thing (but onely my har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes) they reſtored to her a great portion of her deſired ioye, becauſe ſhe ſawe <hi>Medea,</hi> who had taked away <hi>Iaſon</hi> from her, (<hi>Iaſon</hi> forſaking <hi>Medea</hi> for the looue of <hi>Creuſa</hi>) quit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of her once enioyed praye.

            <p>
               <hi>Medea</hi> dyd alſo reioyce for reuenge,<note place="margin">Medea,</note> that ſhe had (although ſhe was no leſſe cruell towardes her ſelfe, then malicious againſt her vngratefull loouer) in killing their common chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in his owne preſence, and conſuming the royall palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of king <hi>Creon</hi> and the new Lady with merciles flames. <hi>Oenone</hi> alſo ſorrowing along time, in fine knewe,<note place="margin">Oenon,</note> that her diſloyall loouer ſuffered due puniſhment for breaking, and corrupting the ſacred lawes of looue, and ſawe his coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trie for the wicked rape and exchaung of her ſelfe for his newe adulterſſe, miſerably waſted, and his owne Cittie ſometimes the ſeate of demie Goddes, and ſemy Goddeſſes, but now an vncouth habitacle and a poore village of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard ſwaines, ouerthrowen &amp; razed cleane from the ground. But truely I loue my gréefs a great deale more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wold eyther with tongue or hart wiſhe ſo ſharpe a reuenge of my wrongfull <hi>Panphilus.

<pb facs="tcp:2998:124"/> his ſonne: So that euery thing duely ſcanned, I finde my ſelfe amongeſt the number of miſerable and deſaſtrous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be tormented with more woes, gréefes and with greater ſorrowe, then any of the reſt, and to haue the ſole principallitie and onely name of all other diſtreſſed women whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>And I can doo no more. But if perhappes (good Ladies) you accompt my framed arguments, but friuolus aſſertions and repute all theſe former examples but weake proofes, as forged in the ſimple conceite of an appaſſionated woman, &amp; if you imagine them (becauſe procéeding from a blinde mind) to be but blind alſo, and of no concluſion, eſtéeming the teres ſighes, and ſorrowes of others, more extreame then mine, and thinking them to be more vnfortunate then my ſelfe, let this onely and laſt propoſition therefore, ſupplie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte (if any there be) of all the reſt before. If he that beareth enuie, is more miſerable, and more wretched, then he to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he dooth beare it, then of all the forenamed perſonnes, I am the moſt miſerable and vnhappie woman. Becauſe I doo greatly emulate, and not a little enuie theyr ordinarie acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes, accounting them not ſo gréeuous, nor ſo full of ſuch great miſerie as mine are.</p>
            <p>Behold therefore (gentle Ladies) how by the olde deceites of iniurious fortune, I breath a moſt wretched woman. And beſides this, ſhe hath doone by me, no otherwiſe then a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle burned to the ſnuffe, doo caſt vp flaſhes of greater light, ſince that (in apparance onely) making truce with my gréefs and giuing ſome pawſe to my dailie woes, and a little caſe to my tormented minde, but by her cruell deſpit againe returning afterwardes to my former teares, and to my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull taſke, of all the wretched women that liue, ſhee hath made mee the moſt miſerable, and the onely recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of all dyſpayre and dole. And becauſe all other compariſons layd aſide, with onely one I may endeuour to make you more aſſured of my newe euilles, I affirme (gentle Ladies) and tell you with that grauitie, that other miſerable women my compeeres may affirme greater, that

Which kind of life, bothe ledde, and lothed of mee, ſo plainly (as (I know) thou canſt well doo) and ſo perticulerly lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before them, that (if in their wilye loues they are but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing warie, and but meanely wiſe) by feare of our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayned harmes, they may be well aduiſed, and forewarned in obuiating the ſecrete and ſubtill deceites of yong Menne.

But as Fortune dooth guide thée, ſo goe thou on. Thy courſe cannot be much inordinate. Thy clowdy times doo hide thy

And put her in mind, that Fortune is euermore vnconſtant and wauering, by which <hi>Caueat</hi> ſhe may knowe, that by the ordinary courſe of her mutabilitie, ſhe may make vs gladde againe, and may bring her to that kinde of painefull life, as ſhe hath now driuen vs vnto, and that then, with like mocks and flowtes, we will requite and pay hers home again. But if thou ſhalt finde any one, that in reading of thée, cannot kéepe the teares from her eyes, but that (condolent and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull of our cares and paines) doth with the ſame multiply thy blots, receiue and gather them, as moſt precious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drops in thy boſome, and mingle them with mine, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhewing thy ſelfe more pittifull &amp; afflicted, requeſt her hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that ſhe would pray for me to him, who dooth with gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den feathers in a moment viſit all the worlde, ſo that entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a more religious mouth, and by more meritorious prayers then mine, (and therefore more plyable to the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of others then to my plaints, he may lighten my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy ſorowes, and take away my oppreſſing anguiſh of mind.

O what happy pittie, and holy pietie ſhould this bee, and then howe would the ſower fruite of this harſhe paines ſéeme ſwéet to my diſtempered taſte. Shunne the eyes of men, of whom, if thou canſt not chooſe but be ſéene, ſpeake vnto them, ſaying. <q rend="margQuotes">O vngratefull generation, decidours and deceiuours of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple women, it is not méete for you (conſidering your deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites) to looke into holy things, and fraught full of ſuch pitty as this is, and, (knowing your remorce of pittie to bee ſo ſmall, as your impietie and cruelty is great) vnfitte to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with diſtreſſed and pittifull things.</q> But if to him, who is the orgaine of all our harmes, thou dooſt chaunce to come, with this exclamation a farre of, gréete him from me, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

And therefore thou ſhall ſay vnto her, that ſhee may a great deale ſooner fall in admiration, howe my troubled witte, my tyred penne, and paynes dyd laſt out, but for that little, which thou dooſt tell out of order, conſidering that feruent loue on the one ſide, and burning iealoſie on the other, with diuers conflicts held my ſorowful ſoule in continuall battayles, thy obſcure and clowdy times féeding the one, and contrary Fortune fauouring the other. Thou maiſt goe ſafely away (as I beléeue) and ſecurely eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from all awaytes, layd to entrappe thée, and néedeſt not care for the cauils of captious heades, becauſe thou mayſt be aſſured that Enuie with her venimous téeth, or infectious tongue ſhall neyther byte, nor ſtyng thée. But if perchaunce thou ſhalt finde any (which I thinke thou neuer canſt) that béeing more miſerable then thy ſelfe, might emulate thée (as one more happy, and not ſo wretched as her ſelfe) then pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſuffer thy ſelfe to be bitten. But I doo not well knowe what part of thée ſhall receiue any newe offence, ſince that with the cruel blowes of angry Fortune I ſée thée torne and broken in euery place. Thou canſt not be iniuried now anie more by her, then already thou art, nor from any high and happy ſeate is ſhe able to make thée fall down, to a more vile
<pb facs="tcp:2998:128"/> and baſe place, for ſo lowe as none may bee lower, is that where now thou dooſt remaine. And admit that ſhe hath not thought it méete to conioyne vs with the ſuperficiall part of the earth, and dooth ſtill ſéeke and ſuppeditate ſtraunger oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to interre vs vnder it, we are ſo beaten and ſo enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to aduerſities, that with thoſe ſhoulders, with which wée haue ſuſtained, and doo yet beare the greateſt and moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie burdens of woes, and ſorrow, wee ſhall with leſſe payne and not with ſo great gréefe beare lighter, and endure leſſer then thoſe.
